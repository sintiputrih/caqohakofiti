From the looks of it, Travis was more than willing to welcome her back into his life with open arms. It’ll be interesting to see where their <a href=#>relationship</a> will take them in the upcoming months!</p><p>After their reunion, the couple has been dating for a while and routinely share photos of one another on social media. In addition, Kayla has been seen at a number of Kelce’s games, demonstrating her support for the star tight end.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> confirmed Kayla and Travis’ <a href=#>relationship</a> in May of 2017.
