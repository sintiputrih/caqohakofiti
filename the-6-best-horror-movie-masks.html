Chances are it’s some sort of evil killer chasing around teenagers and more often than not they’re wearing a mask. Those masks become inextricably linked with the characters that wear them, and some are so iconic a movie poster doesn’t even need words.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=256 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>Jason from Friday the 13th immediately comes to mind, as well as Michael Myers from the Halloween franchise. There are also a bunch of other masks that might not be quite as legendary but still do the job of inspiring fear and malaise in people everywhere.</p><p data-characters=80 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>Not all horror masks are made equally, however. Let’s go through the best.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Michael Myers from Halloween</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/halloween-who-kills-michael-myers.jpg><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>It feels like Michael Myers is having a moment. With the latest movie in the franchise, Halloween Ends, knocking fellow horror movie Smile <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">off the top of the box office</a>, Myers is officially back and still sporting one of the most recognizable horror masks in history.</p><p data-characters=706 data-current-count=973 data-injectable=true>This mask is scary for a few different reasons, the least of which is that it’s actually a mask of William Shatner’s face. In the first Halloween movie from 1978, Myers escapes from Smith’s Grove Sanitarium and steals some necessities from a hardware store, including the mask. There have been some varieties to the mask over the years, but that pasty white facial artifice remains a standard. So how did it come about? Well for starters, the first movie didn’t have the type of budget the new one does. While Halloween Ends boasts a budget of between $20 and $30 million (it’s already made almost 60 as of this writing), the initial film only had about $300,000 to work with.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>This forced some creative cost-cutting measures. Production designer Tommy Lee Wallace <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ended up buying</a> a Star Trek William Shatner mask for two dollars. To make the mask less human, he made the eye holes bigger and he got rid of the sideburns. Then he spray-painted the mask white.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>There were a few other options before the production crew decided on the Shatner mask. At one point it was going to be a clown mask with red hair. A Spock mask and a Richard Nixon mask were also considered. Good thing they went with the Shatner mask, as it’s one of the most recognizable masks of all time.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre.jpg><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>While he’s known as Leatherface, that name is sort of a misnomer as his mask is made from the human skin of his victims. So skinface is a better descriptive term for it. But the leather name doesn’t come from nowhere (we’ll get to that in a second). Leatherface is of course the antagonist from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>There are a total of nine movies, including prequels, sequels, and remakes, but none really match the raw power of that original 1974 classic, which made $30 million on a budget of around $90,000 – not too shabby. So where did the mask come from? The story is somewhat convoluted due to a pretty messy timeline, but there are some things that are canon in the universe.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=706 data-injectable=true>Leatherface’s mom apparently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">worked in a slaughterhouse</a> and died during childbirth. Leatherface was left to die by the slaughterhouse boss but he was taken in by a family and named Thomas Hewitt (he’s also known as Jedidiah Sawyer). The mask comes from having a reaction to a skin disease that severely disfigured his face.</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>He would get made fun of a lot and he wore a leather mask to hide it. This is where the timeline gets tricky but basically he killed someone, was sent to a mental institution, and escaped. Here’s where things get even weirder. Leatherface has a number of skin masks and he wears different ones depending on his mood.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true>For example, he’ll wear an elderly lady mask for his brother and a woman’s mask with lipstick in honor of his mother. Hey – if you forget the whole ‘murder and wear your skin’ thing, he’s kinda sweet! As for the short answer: he’s dealing with childhood trauma.</p><p data-characters=1 data-current-count=1 data-injectable=false></p><h2 id=h-jason-from-friday-the-13th data-injectable=false>Jason from Friday the 13th</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/friday-the-13th.jpeg><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>Jason Voorhees is a legend. One of the most recognizable horror movie villains ever. At this point he’s like Pepsi or Coke, just ingrained into the public consciousness. And that hockey mask – it’s like Weird Al’s curly hair or Michael Jackson’s weird relationship with kids, they don’t exist without each other.</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>The story for how the mask became a thing isn’t as exciting as say – Leatherface, but not everyone can use human skin the way he can. While he’s 100% associated with the hockey mask, Jason actually <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t start wearing it</a> until the third movie. Jason’s mom is the killer in the first movie and when he’s the killer in the second he wears a burlap sack over his face.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=714 data-injectable=true>The reason he wears the mask is unfortunately circumstantial. The third movie was going to be shot in 3D and in the script Jason wore a mask, but the type of mask was never specified. During a lighting check, director Steve Miner asked for a mask and 3D supervisor Martin Jay Sadoff happened to be a big hockey fan.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>He just happened to have a Detroit Red Wings goalie mask, and just like that history was made. In the movie itself, Jason also randomly grabs a hockey mask and puts it on without any real thought. In the 2009 remake, he starts with a burlap sack and it’s knocked off his head and when he goes to pick it up he sees the hockey mask and picks that as an alternative.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false></p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jigsaw’s pig mask from Saw</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Amanda-Young-Saw-Pig.jpg><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>The character that probably comes immediately to mind when we think about the Saw franchise is Billy the Puppet and his cute little bike. However, there’s another thing that really sticks out: the pig mask. It’s something that killer John Kramer and all of his associates use to conceal their identities. There’s also a lot of thought behind it.</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=636 data-injectable=true>Saw writer Leigh Whannell and director James Wan always wanted to incorporate some kind of mask for John and came up with the idea of a rotting pig’s head due to John’s crappy view of the world as well as a reference to the disease that was eating away at him.</p><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>We learn that the mask is a sort of tribute to the Chinese “Year of the Pig,” the same year John started his “work.” The original mask that producers got was from a Halloween store and fairly rote. The makeup artist on the film added things like long black hair and pus to make the mask look more realistic and uncomfortable. The mask eventually became one of the identifying characteristics of the franchise.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ghostface from Scream</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/scream-ghostface.jpg><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true>The Ghostface mask from the Scream franchise was immediately recognizable and also instantly iconic. Like Jason’s mask, the story behind it isn’t as exciting as the character itself. First of all, the mask was meant to be a reference to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">famous Edvard Munch painting</a> “The Scream.”</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>It also references<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> the cover</a> of The Wall by Pink Floyd and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the ghosts</a> from old Betty Boop cartoons. The mask also wasn’t created for the movie. It was bought from a company called Fun World as a part of a series called “Fantastic Faces.” After the movie it became the most worn costume of all time in the United States.</p><p data-characters=107 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>Screenwriter Kevin Williamson told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Slashfilm</a> that at first they couldn’t figure out what mask to use.</p><p>“No one could agree on a mask and I remember we were in a location scout, and we found Ghostface… in a box of stuff in a garage… Wes [Craven] immediately looked at it and said, ‘This is like the famous Scream painting.’ And so we took that to our production and we said, ‘Riff on this… make something like this.’ They must’ve done 20 different designs. Every one of them was rejected by the studio, and finally we were like, why don’t we just get the rights to this mask?”</p><p data-characters=38 data-current-count=38 data-injectable=false>Sometimes it’s just that simple.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Hannibal Lecter from Silence of the Lambs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/hannibal_lecter.jpg><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true>Psychological horror has come a long way since 1991’s seminal classic The Silence of The Lambs, but those movies have a lot of debt to pay to Anthony Hopkins and his character Hannibal Lecter – a performance so good it won him an Oscar for best actor. Part of his iconography is the wire mask they used on his face.</p><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=203 data-injectable=false>Like a lot of other horror films, the production crew couldn’t quite figure out exactly how they wanted the mask to look. There were actually a number of different options, which you can see below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>ANTHONY HOPKINS trying out the different mask options as Hannibal Lecter in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZKO1PZPo2o</a></p>— FilmFrame (@FilmFrameATRM) <a href=#>February 3, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false>Because they couldn’t quite agree on anything they decided to make their own, according to a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“making of” feature</a>. Costume designer Colleen Atwood said eventually they agreed on a design and decided to make it out of a certain material.</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true>“We got more to the idea of the fiberglass mask. The thought had been for the mask to have a finish on it, but when we received the [final] sample, it was raw fiberglass, which looked like an old piece of dried up leather — or even skin. And it was so great, so it never went back for its paint job.”</p><p data-characters=64 data-current-count=64 data-injectable=false>Once they found the right mask, everything else fell into place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXWt6o7HSrWShp6KnvLN5zKitop1doq60t9Jo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cerro-gordo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Abandoned California Boomtown That Went Bust">&larr;
