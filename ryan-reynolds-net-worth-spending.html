Blessed with a seemingly effortless charm, good looks, and a spectacular sense of humor, Reynolds seems to have been born to be a movie star. In fact, not only is Reynolds a massive star today, he is seemingly poised to become an even bigger deal in the years to come. After all, when Disney bought Fox, one of the first things they announced is that Reynolds would be joining the <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> as Deadpool.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds has suffered some real heartache</a> over the years, it is clear that he has a lot going for him. After all, from the outside looking in, Reynolds appears to be supremely happy in his marriage and he seems to adore his kids. Of course, Reynolds has also been able to amass an impressive amount of money due to all of the movies he has headlined. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, what does Reynolds spend his enormous net worth on?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Ryan Reynolds' Life Has Changed Since Portraying Deadpool</a></span></p><h2 id=making-his-fortune>Making His Fortune</h2><p>As one of the biggest movie stars in the world today, it likely won’t surprise anyone that Ryan Reynolds is an extremely wealthy person. After all, Reynolds has headlined many hit films at this point and it has been reported that he is a big enough deal that he has joined the elite club of actors who can demand $20 million per role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to all of the money that Ryan Reynolds has made as an actor, he has also brought in a fortune due to his business prowess. For example, Reynolds made money from serving as Mint Mobile’s spokesperson at the same time he bought a stake of the company and cashed in from that. If that wasn’t impressive enough, <a href=#>Reynolds brought home a ridiculous amount of cash when Aviation Gin sold for $610 million</a> since he held a major stake in the company.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Ryan Reynolds Had To Go Through To Be 'Deadpool'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=big-money-purchases>Big Money Purchases</h2><p>Given the fact that Ryan Reynolds has amassed so much money, it makes perfect sense that he has spent a small fortune on several things over the years. For example, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reynolds and his wife Blake Lively reportedly spent roughly $6 million on their New York home</a> that was built in 1960. Unsurprisingly, Reynolds and Lively’s home has lots of space considering it contains seven bedrooms and 6 bathrooms. As Lively has also shown off on Instagram in the past, their home also has a massive closet with seemingly endless shelves she has filled with her shoe collection. According to reports, Reynolds and Lively also own an apartment in a high-end Tribeca building.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to the expensive homes he owns with his wife, <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds also has a mind-blowing collection of vehicles</a>. For example, according to reports, Reynolds owns a classic Didge Challenger, a 2012 Chevy Equinox, a 2011 Toyota Prius, a 2012 Nissan Leaf, and a Cadillac Escalade. On top of his many cars, Reynolds also has bought several motorcycles over the years. Most notably, Reynolds is the owner of a Triumph Tiger, a 1975 Honda CB750, a fully customized 1964 Triumph 650, a Ducati By Paul Smart, a Triumph Bonneville, and a Triumph Thruxton By Kott Motorcycles. Considering that it is known that Reynolds owns several more motorcycles and likely more cars, it seems very clear he loves to go fast.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Just Some Amazing Things Blake Lively And Ryan Reynolds Have Done For The World</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=funding-the-role-of-a-lifetime>Funding The Role Of A Lifetime</h2><p>As anyone who has followed Ryan Reynolds’ career will be able to attest, he is best known for playing Deadpool on the big screen. Given the fact that Reynolds is so perfect in that role and both of the movies he headlined as the character were huge hits, it seems hard to believe Fox wasn’t excited to bankroll Deadpool movies from the beginning. Despite that, Reynolds had to fight very hard to get the first Deadpool film off the ground.</p><p>After playing a poorly received version of Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine through no fault of his own, Ryan Reynolds was determined to do the character justice. For that reason, Reynolds convinced the bigwigs at Fox to fund test footage for the Deadpool movie he wanted to make but from there, the studio began dragging their feet. Fortunately, that Deadpool test footage was leaked online and fans went wild. In the years since Reynolds has heavily implied he was the one who leaked the test footage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amazingly enough, even after Fox agreed to make a Deadpool movie, they clearly had cold feet to a certain degree. After all, it has since come out that even though Reynolds insisted it was necessary to have the people who scripted Deadpool on the set to help guide the filming process, Fox wouldn’t pay their salary. Since he has the money and he really cared about Deadpool turning out right, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reynolds spent a portion of his fortune to personally pay Deadpool’s writers</a> to be on set every day.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How Ryan Reynolds' Life Has Changed Since Portraying Deadpool</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipspmeYr%2Bmxc2oo52rXaOytXnWqKmtoF2ovaa6w6KloGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-leni-olumi-klums-biological-dad.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Leni Olumi Klums Biological Dad?">&larr;
