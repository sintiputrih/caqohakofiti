Over the next year he continued to record his album with guitarist <a href=#>Mark Kelly</a>, New York drummer <a href=#>Tom Osander</a> aka Tomo, Paris pianist Jean Meunier, London producer <a href=#>David Arnold</a>, County Meath vocalist <a href=#>Lisa Hannigan</a> and cellist Vyvienne Long. Rice then embarked on a tour of Ireland with Hannigan, Tomo, Vyvienne, Mark and Dublin bassist Shane Fitzsimons.</p><p>Based in Straffan, Co. Kildare, the band continued touring and signed a six album record deal with Polygram. Their recording projects generated the singles "Weatherman" and "The World Is Dead" which received favourable reviews. They also recorded but never released "Tongue". After achieving his musical goals with Juniper, Rice became frustrated with the artistic compromises required by the record label, and he left the band in 1998. Rice moved to Tuscany in Italy and took up farming for some time, then returned to Ireland before busking around Europe. After returning to Ireland a second time, Rice gave a demo recording to his second cousin, music producer <a href=#>David Arnold</a>, who then gave Rice a mobile studio.</p><p>Rice was born in Dublin to George and Maureen Rice, and raised in Celbridge, Ireland. Rice formed the rock band Juniper along with <a href=#>Paul Noonan</a>, Dominic Philips, <a href=#>David Geraghty</a> and <a href=#>Brian Crosby</a> in 1991. The band met whilst they were attending Salesian College secondary school in Celbridge, Co. Kildare as students. After touring throughout Ireland, the band released their debut EP Manna in 1995.</p><p>Rice began his musical career as a member of the 1990s rock group Juniper, who were signed to Polygram Records in 1997. The band enjoyed moderate success with a couple of single releases, but a projected album floundered because of record company politics. After leaving Juniper, he worked as a farmer in Tuscany and busked throughout Europe before returning to Ireland in 2001 and beginning a solo career. The rest of the band went on to become Bell X1.</p><p>Damien Rice (born 7 December 1973) is an Irish singer-songwriter, musician and record producer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfma6utcSnZKuhk5o%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-danielle-cohn-13-years-old-4.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Danielle Cohn 13 years old?
