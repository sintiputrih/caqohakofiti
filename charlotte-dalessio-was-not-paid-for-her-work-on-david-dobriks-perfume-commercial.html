Beyond YouTube, he’s dabbled in everything from puzzle games to an app.</p><p>David’s Perfume, his perfume line, was launched in October 2020. He’d hired Charlotte D’Alessio to help with the branding, and the two had collaborated on a commercial. D’Alessio recently revealed that Dobrik did not compensate her for the advertisement.</p><h2>Charlotte D’Alessio Was Not Compensated For Her Advertising.</h2><p>The YouTuber debuted the commercial for his scent on his channel on October 2, 2020. Dobrik and D’Alessio played a couple for a little over a minute.</p><p>The duo promoted David’s Perfume’s two debut scents with the song “Getaway” by Saint Motel. D’Alessio revealed she was not paid for the advertisement more than a year after it was released.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/David-Dobrik-js.jpg><p>On January 20, 2022, she appeared on Dobrik and Jason Nash’s podcast Views to discuss the commercial. D’Alessio, according to the YouTuber, was the ideal girl to promote his perfume, and she did so admirably.<br>Nash then inquired as to whether she was compensated for the advertisement. The model claimed she was not paid, but Dobrik’s assistant Natalie Mariduena offered to compensate her.</p><p>D’Alessio, on the other hand, refused to accept the payment. Dobrik reminded her of the watch he had given her as a gift. He joked that he got it for $3.95 at the Bowling Alley’s claw machines.</p><p>D’Alessio, on the other hand, was grateful for the gift, saying she loved it and wore it “all the time.” The commercial went viral after it was broadcast.</p><p>As a result, it’s no surprise that Dobrik’s perfumes were an instant hit and sold out almost immediately.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Charlotte-DAlessio-jsj.jpg><p>His #01 scent is a finalist for The Fragrance Foundation Awards in 2021, according to David’s Perfume’s website. In an interview with People, the YouTuber revealed that he was inspired to start David’s Perfume by a stranger. Dobrik was completely enamored with the stranger’s scent.</p><p>He thought he’d “discovered a new smell” and wanted to share it with his younger audience. It took him over a year to develop the product, which he did with the assistance of Vlog Squad.</p><p>Everything was eventually completed in 2020, and he released them in October of that year. He began with two perfumes and has not yet expanded his brand.</p><h2>Is Charlotte D’Alessio Dating David Dobrik?</h2><p>Following Liza Koshy, Dobrik has been linked to a number of women. D’Alessio is one of them. The rumors began after the commercial for the perfume was released.</p><p>Many people assumed they were a couple in real life because they portrayed one. In an interview with Access, Dobrik debunked the rumors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Charlotte-DAlessio.jpg><p>He gushed over D’Alessio, saying she was extremely professional throughout the commercial. He also gave her credit for teaching him how to act and model.</p><p>Unlike the rumors, however, the video was solely for the purpose of promoting his brand, not their relationship. As a result, they are not dating, regardless of how well they played a couple in the commercial.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Charlotte D'Alessio</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>David Dobrik</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaoZmioby1wMRmm5qklajAqruMsJisZZ6kwW68wKKbZp6fp3qpsdFmrqiqm2K8r3nDmq2inF2ZvKO%2ByKSqZqiVp7O2ucRmmqilnZq%2FpLXApWY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gunplay-net-worth-179857.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gunplay Net Worth">&larr;
