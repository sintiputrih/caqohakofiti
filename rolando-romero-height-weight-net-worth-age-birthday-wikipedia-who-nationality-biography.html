As of January 2022, he had contended in 14 sessions in his expert vocation and had won every one of them. 12 of those successes had come through knockout.</p><p>The 2 different successes had come by means of consistent choice and one of those was his success over Jackson Marinez through which he had won the WBA interval lightweight title.</p><table class="tablepress tablepress-id-3"><tbody><tr class="row-2 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Height</strong></td><td class=column-2>5 ft 8 in</td></tr><tr class="row-3 odd"><td class=column-1><strong>Weight</strong></td><td class=column-2>61 kg</td></tr><tr class="row-4 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td class=column-2>October 14, 1995</td></tr><tr class="row-5 odd"><td class=column-1><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong></td><td class=column-2>Libra</td></tr><tr class="row-6 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td class=column-2>Dark Brown</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Having contended in his first expert session in December 2016, Rolando had amassed an impeccable 11-0 success misfortune record by February 2020 after which he was given the option to confront undefeated Dominican fighter, Jackson Marinez, for the empty WBA interval lightweight title.</p><p>The session was booked for August 2020 and Rolando had caught the title by means of consistent choice (after 12 rounds) with the adjudicators’ scorecards perusing 118-110, 116-112, and 115-113. Notwithstanding, the adjudicators’ choice turned out to be very dubious as many fans and media people felt that Jackson was the meriting victor.</p><p>His next session was booked for January 2021 against Justin Pauldo. In any case, Justin was recorded 5lbs over the contracted load after which Rolando’s group had consented to change the contracted load to 140 lbs. Regardless of the two sides consenting to the new terms, the session must be dropped after Justin had bombed a pre-battle physical.</p><p>Avery Sparrow was then organized as a latest possible moment adversary whom Rolando figured out how to overcome in the seventh round through TKO. He was profoundly disparaging of Avery’s battling style after the session, in any event, naming his rival a ‘quitter’.</p><p>He was then planned to shield his title against Austin Dulay in July 2021 however the last option had removed only a couple of days before the booked date after which Rolando had asserted that Austin had pulled out because of a ‘fit of anxiety’.</p><p>Austin had reacted by expressing that he experienced a knee injury and had even proposed to give Rolando USD 10k out of his battle tote to reschedule the session.</p><p>Notwithstanding, that didn’t happen as Anthony Yigit was approached to turn into Rolando’s new adversary. The WBA interval lightweight title was as of now not on the line, however, on the grounds that Anthony had shown up 5.2 lbs over the 135 lb limit. Rolando traveled to triumph in the seventh round by means of TKO.</p><p>In October 2021, various charges of s*xual attack were made against him. In any case, no charges had been documented against him as the claims couldn’t be validated. Regardless of this, he had been pulled from his December 2021 session against Gervonta Davis.</p><p>Instagram account.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqfoa6vsM5mqaillae8brTEop6hrF2ssqqzx61kp52kYsSwvtOhZJqflWKvqr7ToZuasV2stqy1z56bopldrLWwec2aq6Knnpa5qsDYZpmip5enrrG02Gg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./scandal-rowan-frames-jake-harrison-jerry-death-recap-season-4.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rowan Frames Jake For Jerry &amp;amp; Harrisons Death  Season 4 Recap  Hollywood Life">&larr;
