I got the idea to make a healthier version of the classic pudding pop from memories of hot summer days when I was growing up. When my sister and I were younger, our goal in life was to catch the ice cream truck. We’d play outside in the yard with our neighbor friends all day until one of us yelled&nbsp;“sshhhhhhhh!!!!” and then we’d all run to opposite ends of the yard to figure out&nbsp;which direction that whimsical sound of&nbsp;The Entertainer was coming from. When&nbsp;we would close in on the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>My sweet breakfast kick continues. For over a year, I was on a&nbsp;nonstop savory & spicy breakfast kick. Next came the carrot-ey baked goods, and now we’re onto these vegan scones. Or I should say, the royal&nbsp;“we” are on to these scones. Jack loves them too, but my dirty secret is that he only has one or two out of every batch because I hide the extras in the freezer – where I know he will never look (well, until he reads this). Vegan Scones Ingredients These little treats are vegan and gluten-free. Instead of butter and cream, they’re made…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This healthy green smoothie is my latest breakfast obsession. If you’ve been reading the blog for a while, you know that I go in and out of breakfast kicks. I’ll eat one type of food every morning for a few weeks before moving on to the next phase. I’ve cycled through muffins, eggs, overnight oats, hot oatmeal, porridge, and more, but I have to say, this green smoothie kick might just stick around. I love starting my day knowing that I’ve already had multiple servings of fresh fruits and vegetables, and this particular green smoothie is really delicious. It’s healthy,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Currently, I’m sitting inside with three shirts on, one scarf, and one coat. I’ve been in Chicago for the last few days visiting my family, and it’s no surprise that I showed up just in time for the first snow. It always knows when I’m coming. In my parents’ house, there are 3 options to get warm&nbsp;– first, don’t take your coat off, and second, turn up the heat when no one is looking… but by far the most effective method is to BAKE. Crank that oven and when you’re done leave it open to feel every last bit of…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you saw what I eat for breakfast every day, you would be so bored. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love my daily eggs & avocado, but lately I’ve&nbsp;been&nbsp;trying to switch things up just because I think change is good every once in a while. Especially if that change means another excuse to smother things in peaches. This quinoa breakfast bowl is inspired by the beautiful bowls of oatmeal that I see all over the internet. You know the ones – they’re chock full of colorful fruit and other various superfoods. They’re so pretty that they make me&nbsp;wish I…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>To say that we’re obsessed with cold brew coffee is an understatement. It’s the only coffee we drink at home now – the only reason we still own a coffee maker (which is now stored up on the highest shelf) is for when parents come to visit. I didn’t know it was possible to make cold brew yourself, but it’s more than possible, it’s easy. I’ve been buying my cold brew by the bottle, but when&nbsp;I started seeing homemade versions all over the internet (here, here, here, here), I was intrigued. But let’s back up –&nbsp;what is cold brew coffee…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Let’s eat the rainbow! Or, with these healthy breakfast smoothies, drink the rainbow through a straw (or scoop it up with a spoon… how you like to enjoy your smoothie is really up to you). How to Meal Prep Healthy Breakfast Smoothies Today we’re continuing our “grab & go” series with Almond Breeze, (see parts 1, 2 and 3). The idea with these breakfast smoothies is that you assemble all of your fruits & vegetables ahead of time so that your morning smoothie is fast and easy to make. Chop up your fruit (and veggies if you want a green…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>In case you haven’t noticed, I sort of have a thing for matcha. I know it’s SO trendy… but I personally think it’s exciting to see really great healthy foods become insanely popular. Everyone’s drinking matcha lattes and matcha mochas these days – but now that it’s almost summer, here’s a really simple ice cream treat. This one’s really more of an idea than a “recipe.” I didn’t even bother breaking out the blender to make these milkshakes because in the spirit of our “grab and go” monthly series with Almond Breeze, I wanted to make these simple enough to…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Let me start out by saying: I’m not a cereal person. I’ve told this story before – my sister and I used to BEG my mom for all of the artificially colored sugary cereals with fun cartoon characters… sometimes she’d give in but always with the disclaimer “only if you actually eat it this time.”&nbsp;We would excitedly make this promise&nbsp;only to go home, have one bowl and never touch it again. This granola, however – I’ll happily eat cereal-style.&nbsp;But with almond milk instead of regular milk because we all know that Almond Breeze is my go-to milk. Amaranth is a…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>For years, I had a very routine&nbsp;“breakfast” that I&nbsp;would pick&nbsp;up on my way to work: a double tall soy latte at 110 degrees. (I know, I was one of those coffee-orderers). These days,&nbsp;I’ve swapped my beverage breakfast for a real one, my expensive coffee for tea, and my soy milk for almond milk. Although I now work from home, I still love to get a quick start in the morning. Which is why I’m so excited about this recipe –&nbsp;this&nbsp;latte is SO simple and is made up of ingredients from my spice drawer which makes me wonder how I ever…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Hot chocolate always has to come with warm fuzzy memories, doesn’t it?&nbsp;I vividly remember being about 9 – otherwise known as the age when snow was fun. My sister and I would spend hours and hours building forts and making snow angels. We’d come in the house with red noses and leave our snowpants in a puddle at the door (you know, for mom to clean up). We’d sit down to mugs of Swiss Miss hot chocolate, no marshmallows for me. I might not have wintery white Christmases anymore, but here’s my fancy adult white hot chocolate that’s made oh…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfqa6oe8ClpKimlGK6qrjKaKean5Vkf3A%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-money-does-kay-story-make-latest-kay-story-net-worth-income-salary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Kay Story Make?
