It was May 16, Friday night at the early show," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the LA Times reported</a>.</p><p>Turns out, there was some serious smoke getting into the venue, and the cop was trying to give the band a warning. He did so, however, in a way that sparked a rash reaction.</p><p>"He rushed the British rock band and tried to wrestle the microphone away from singer Roger Daltrey to warn them about heavy smoke wafting through from a fire next door," Mental Floss wrote about the incident.</p><p>The band had no idea what was going on, nor did they know that the guy was a cop. In turn, Townshend reacted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Anyway, Townshend was arrested for kicking this guy off the stage when he started yelling to the crowd," the article stated.</p><p>The LA Times article noted that the venue was cleared out, and that no danger was imminent.</p><p>"The crowd outside was humongous. We had to get the house out. We (Bill’s staff) were commended for handling the situation without any injuries," they wrote, while adding "Later we learned that we were in no danger; the show could have gone on. The charges were later dropped, the late show was postponed to Sunday. All in all, an exciting nite at the Fillmore."</p><p>In 2018, Who frontman, Roger Daltrey, talked about the incident.</p><p>"There was a warrant out for Pete’s and my arrest because we kicked a cop off the stage. He was in plain clothes. He ran on the stage while we were in the middle of ‘Tommy’ and took my microphone away.

He hatched a plan to enlist the help of The Who’s guitarist Pete Townshend to get the water-filled mattress down into the lobby. He attempted to move the gelatinous blob into the elevator with Pete and send it down. However, before they could, they hit a snag and the mattress burst, emptying an unfathomable amount of water into the hotel room and halls," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Far Out Magazine reported</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Believe us when we say that this is incredibly tame compared to the insane list of things they've done.</p><p>To be fair, while the band was off their hinges, they remain one of rock's best acts.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/journey-s-legacy-took-a-hit-after-steve-perry-s-reported-lawsuit-against-his-former-band-members-front-deposit-back-wikipedia.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Journey's Legacy Took A Hit After Steve Perry's Reported Lawsuit Against His Former Band Members">Journey's Legacy Took A Hit After Steve Perry's Reported Lawsuit Against His Former Band Members</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Journey's former and current members have been feuding a lot lately.</p><h2 id=controveries-aside-they-39-re-one-of-the-best-bands-ever>Controveries Aside, They're One Of The Best Bands Ever</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-who-band-members-keith-moon.jpg><p>Back in the 1960s, The Who's rise to prominence was propelled by a string of groundbreaking albums. My Generation, their debut album, catapulted the group to mainstream success.
