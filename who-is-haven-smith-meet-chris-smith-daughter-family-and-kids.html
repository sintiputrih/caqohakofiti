Chris Smith, a 31-year-old American professional football player, died on April 17, 2023. He has spent eight years in the National Football League (NFL).</p><p>He was a member of five teams throughout his remarkable career: the Jacksonville Jaguars, Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, Las Vegas Raiders, and Baltimore Ravens. Chris attended the University of Arkansas, where he was a star defensive end. Smith was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the fifth round of the 2014 NFL Draft.&nbsp;Smith’s death at the age of 31 stunned the football community and his admirers. He will be remembered as a gifted player, a generous philanthropist, and a kind soul.</p><h2>Chris Smith’s NFL Daughter: Haven Smith</h2><p>Smith has three children, but no information about his other children has been made public. Chris and his late girlfriend, Petara Cordero, had their third child, Haven Smith. Haven was just four months old when she lost her mother, Petara, in August 2019. Haven Smith tragically lost her mother, Petara Cordero, in a vehicle accident three years before the death of her father, Chris Smith. This implies Haven suffered the heartbreaking death of her parents at an early age.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chris-smith-2.jpg alt="chris smith" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>There is no information accessible online on Smith’s other two children. Chris sought to keep his information hidden from the media and sources.&nbsp;He had not given any information about his girlfriend or his children’s mother, in addition to his children.</p><h2>Chris Smith’s Family</h2><p>Chris Smith was born on February 11, 1992, to William and Sherry Smith. His parents were highly supportive of his work path and decision, and the news of his death grieved all of his parents.&nbsp;His parents were proud of him and where he had gotten to. They were always there to lift his spirits. William and Sherry Smith, Chris Smith’s parents, were both interested in religious activities. His father, William, worked in a Christian church as a deacon and lay officer, aiding the pastor and serving the congregation.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sherry, his mother, was a pastor, which is a spiritual leader who directs and instructs a congregation or religious group.&nbsp;Smith’s attitude and morals were most likely affected by growing up in a family with devout parents.&nbsp;Smith was noted for his charitable activities and compassion, as proven by the foundation he established in honor of his late lover.&nbsp;Smith started his football career as a defensive end at Mount Ulla High School in North Carolina.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chris-smith-2.jpg alt="chris smith" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The guy subsequently went on to play collegiate football for the University of Arkansas, where he was a defensive end.&nbsp;Smith was subsequently selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the fifth round of the 2014 NFL Draft. He spent three seasons with the Jaguars before being traded to the Cincinnati Bengals in 2017.&nbsp;Smith played for five clubs in his eight-year NFL career, including the Jaguars, Bengals, Cleveland Browns, Las Vegas Raiders, and Baltimore Ravens.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsButMCvnKdlo6K2tbSMppyerF2YtbO10maqpqGknXqlrdSgn62domKzornIpbBmmZ6Zeqy1w6xm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dj-uiagalelei-enters-transfer-portal-exploring-his-decision-and-potential-destinations.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="DJ Uiagalelei Enters Transfer Portal: Exploring His Decision and Potential Destinations">&larr;
