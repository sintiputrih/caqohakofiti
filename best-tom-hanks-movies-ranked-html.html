The actor contains <a href=#>multitudes</a> but is always Tom Hanks. As a result, he’s often accused of playing one character: the fundamentally decent, good-hearted, noble but humble all-American Everyman. There’s some truth to this, of course — Hanks wouldn’t work as Travis Bickle, no matter how hard he tried. But it’s not fair to paint Hanks as playing the same character over and over, and it certainly wouldn’t be fair to say he doesn’t challenge himself or take chances. Hanks has transformed himself from the party dude of Bachelor Party to the romantic lead of Sleepless in Seattle to the war hero of Saving Private Ryan to the six different characters he plays, amusingly, in Cloud Atlas. The guy may play only a certain number of notes, but he always manages to make them sound unique.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck38vgors00413g67nlxbk8xd@published data-word-count=58>Thus we present you with our complete ranking of Hanks’s movie roles, up to and including Asteroid City.

It’s cheapo schlock, but it’ll live forever because of Hanks’s appearance as a student who’s skeptical that the protagonist is really being stalked. His dialogue clearly sets him up to be murdered, but the filmmakers liked him so much that they decided to let his character live. Even in his first movie, Hanks was charming everybody.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtng7ug001b3h6bnwa7ewg7@published>51. <a data-vars-anchor-text="The Man With One Red Shoe" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>The Man With One Red Shoe</a> (1985)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck37uriwh000w3g67yv788al7@published data-word-count=60>An instantly forgettable “comedy thriller” in which Hanks plays a doofus concert pianist thrust clumsily into a murder mystery. He’s clearly dialed up a little too high in order to carry a thin, empty premise, but still, check out the supporting cast: Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, Jim Belushi, Edward Herrmann, and a finally-done-playing-Leia (for another 30 years, anyway) Carrie Fisher.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl7uqb8ij000s3b6v92mrhgqf@published>50.

This is another one of those roles, like Mr. Rogers or Ben Bradlee or Walt Disney himself (all parts he’s better at than this), in which Hanks is essentially cast simply for being Tom Hanks, which means all that really matters is what else he brings to the role. The answer here is “not much.” He stands where he’s supposed to stand and does not look actively embarrassed to be there — which, in this fiasco, requires considerable skill — but otherwise looks grateful to disappear for most of the movie. You’ll be envious of him.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtngzx3001g3h6bgtqolph9@published>49. <a data-vars-anchor-text="The Circle" href=#>The Circle</a> (2017)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck37uriwj000y3g67d1wz0uzk@published data-word-count=175>How Dave Eggers’s smart novel about technology got turned into this total mess of a movie remains a little baffling two years after its release. James Ponsoldt is a smart director who would seem to have a natural affinity to this material, the cast is once-in-a-lifetime great (Emma Watson! John Boyega! Patton Oswalt! Bill Paxton’s last role!), and the time would seem right for a good hard look at what exactly the human tolls of massive corporate tech really are. Unfortunately, the movie is a fiasco from the start, confused, disorganized, and often nonsensical; this one just appears to have gotten away from Ponsoldt. Hanks could have been a perfect fit as the supposedly wise, benevolent Steve Jobs–type character who is secretly a supervillain, but the movie can’t focus enough on him to let him do much more than make a couple of speeches and then sneer lightly when he gets his comeuppance. It’s a shame: This would have been a great Tom Hanks bad guy performance if the movie had just let it happen.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtni6q9001l3h6bbycxzb1e@published>48. <a data-vars-anchor-text="The Bonfire of the Vanities" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>The Bonfire of the Vanities</a> (1990)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck37uriwm000z3g67vzamanaq@published data-word-count=119>“I did everything I could to make it work,” Hanks<a href=#> said in 1992</a> about this Brian De Palma debacle. “And the fallout from it was that it makes you reflect for a while. You question yourself. But what can you do? You take your shots and you swing away.” Yes, this adaptation of Tom Wolfe’s Zeitgeist-y novel was a failure, but it’s an interesting failure in lots of ways, not least of which is watching Hanks trying to play the story’s Master-of-the-Universe Wall Street operative. He has the character’s All-American features but not the toxic spirit, which fatally wounds the entire film.

The one-joke premise is that the dream house Hanks and Long have bought is falling apart, and the movie keeps trying to find new ways to make that exact point, with diminishing results. Hanks doesn’t look bored with this lane yet, but he is starting to seem a little exhausted.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtnl8hj000x3h6bab8izblb@published>45. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Every Time We Say Goodbye" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Every Time We Say Goodbye</a> (1986)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck37uriwr00123g67rnzad33t@published data-word-count=63>This was Hanks’s first attempt at “stretching” in a saccharine love story set during World War II in which he plays a soldier who loses his true love.

This is high-concept and tiresome, and Gleason, in particular, hams it up every time he’s onscreen, but this was the start of Hanks’s pivot toward a more “serious” screen persona. He’s not particularly funny in the film; he’s trying to play this one straight.

The technologically groundbreaking but narratively uneven Polar Express animates Chris Van Allsburg’s children’s book through what was a fancy new innovation at the time: motion-capture. The dead-eyed look of the film’s characters still haunts our dreams, but we also object to Hanks’s overly cutesy performances as the conductor, Santa Claus, and others. It’s a fine line when acting in a movie that’s meant to be magical: You get the balance wrong, and the whole thing ends up feeling aggressively adorable and self-satisfied.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtnrlyg00203h6bx69eflvb@published>38. <a data-vars-anchor-text="The Da Vinci Code" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>The Da Vinci Code</a> (2006)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck37urix100193g67h76ubqhi@published data-word-count=50>Hanks and Ron Howard’s adaptation of Dan Brown’s blockbuster novel is by-the-numbers and uninspired, but it’s professionally done in a way that’s mostly inoffensive.

That’s largely because he’s barely in it, playing the dead father of the film’s autistic young hero (Thomas Horn) who goes on a quest across the city to solve a riddle his dad left for him. In flashbacks, Hanks is more than credible as a man who fears for his sensitive son, but the overt preciousness of this Oscar-nominated enterprise makes it hard to see that sincerity through the aggressive pretension.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtnub8k002i3h6b7955tc8u@published>36. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Larry Crowne" href=#>Larry Crowne</a> (2011)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck37urix4001b3g67fh9zgca8@published data-word-count=108>Hanks’s second film as director was a bust: a well-intentioned look at working-class Americans who were rocked by the 2008 financial collapse that ended up playing patronizing and glib. He plays Larry, a normal joe who gets fired from his Walmart-like job and has to reinvent himself, falling in love with Julia Roberts’s college professor in the process. Larry Crowne is the sort of movie that makes you understand why conservatives go off on tirades about out-of-touch, liberal Hollywood stars. There isn’t a whiff of reality to this story, and Hanks is like an alien trying to play an everyman — he’s rarely seemed so uncomfortable and unconvincing.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cldm1bzwv000b3b6uefz5s6qs@published>35.

This remake of a 2015 Swedish film allows Hanks to kinda sorta play a curmudgeon, albeit one who proves to be a lovable cuss before you know it. As Otto, an older man who has lost his beloved wife and his job, he’s teetering into his golden years with a grouchy attitude. Otto is also suicidal — something A Man Called Otto never sufficiently dramatizes, cheapening the codger’s despair as the film prepares for the feel-good ending to come. Hanks is, of course, fairly empathetic in the role, but he never sells the idea that Otto is anything more than a slightly perturbed gent. There’s no sense of real darkness, real misanthropy, or real conflict because Hanks never dares to reveal the man’s unlikability. As a result, the character’s transformation is too easy, the performance a little too lazy and self-satisfied.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl4wwajsp000j3b6ts18kka1y@published>34. <a data-vars-anchor-text=Elvis href=#>Elvis</a> (2022)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4wwagzb000e3b6twaoqy2ac@published data-word-count=217>Future generations won’t remember this, but anyone living during the coronavirus will perhaps always think of&nbsp;Baz Luhrmann’s portrait of the King as “the movie during which Tom Hanks got COVID.” Indeed, the Oscar-winning actor was one of the first high-profile celebrities to be infected at the start of the pandemic, generating plenty of concern and well-wishes at a time when we were all struggling with the uncertainty of what the future held. Thankfully, Hanks recovered, delivering a performance in&nbsp;Elvis&nbsp;that is … well, what exactly&nbsp;is&nbsp;he doing as Colonel Tom Parker, the man who guided (and manipulated) Elvis Presley in the early stages of his career? This is certainly one of Hanks’s oddest, ballsiest turns, leaning hard into that strange accent while hiding behind distracting prosthetics. The initial reactions out of the film’s Cannes premiere were a bit hostile (which is <a href=#>typical of a festival that caters to hyperbolic responses</a>, both positive and negative), but for the man’s fans,&nbsp;Elvis&nbsp;isn’t that dissimilar from his go-for-broke portrayal(s) in&nbsp;Cloud Atlas. Which is to say: Hanks seems to be having a ball, which is rewarding to see in an older actor of his stature who is still willing to take risks. That those risks don’t ultimately work isn’t necessarily that bad.

Hanks is the young, “cool” cop contrasting with Dan Aykroyd’s Joe Friday impression, and he has as much fun as you can in a silly movie in which Aykroyd considers himself the star. The major takeaway is a deeply disturbing “rap” video Aykroyd and Hanks made to promote the film. Watch at your own peril. “I’m here tonight, to rap about your rights.” Yikes.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtnvnfw002x3h6bx2ongm5n@published>32. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Bachelor Party" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Bachelor Party</a> (1984)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckbtnwdoe003d3h6bb94uewaf@published data-word-count=72>Your mileage is going to vary on a lot of the Tom Hanks, Disposable Lead of Dopey ’80s Comedies, entries, but this one is definitely one of the silliest, dumbest and, amusingly, most eternal: There are movies from this time period that Hanks can hide from now, but this is definitely not one of them.

Still, the disappointment extends to Hanks’s portrayal. He’s a more-than-credible Walt, amplifying the man’s megawatt showmanship and gregariousness, but it doesn’t zig or zag in any interesting directions.

That’s just as true of Hanks’s performances, which are a warning that bad wigs and weird makeup do not good characters make.

But that supporting shot of Hanks is the perfect amount: Hanks might be a little bit too big and a little bit too modern to truly inhabit Rogers, but the way he conjures his spirit, that quiet grace, is uncanny and even quite moving. Hanks never reaches for effect and remains spiritually and physically calm: His Mr. Rogers is unknowable, unfathomable, but absolutely irresistible.

But his performance, like the movie, has more going on than just stunt casting: It’s rigorous, well thought through, and just lovely.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtofxij006v3h6b4m0rvpn1@published>7. <a data-vars-anchor-text="The Post" href=#>The Post</a> (2017)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck37urixw00233g67git74oaz@published data-word-count=157>Late in his career, Hanks has become such an instant audience surrogate — a quiet subtext to his performances is always Tom Hanks is here so it’s going to be okay — that you can almost overlook how strong he is as Ben Bradlee here. He’s taking over the role that Jason Robards won an Oscar playing in All the President’s Men, and while he has a little bit of the Robards gristle, he adds that special Hanks ingredient: sincerity. You never once believe Tom Hanks is on the wrong side here; that Hanks’s Bradlee is willing to question himself — is willing to admit his own mistakes — makes him that much easier, and important, to cheer for. Hanks has added a bit of lovable irascibility in his later roles, and he wears it well. It’s actually sort of amazing he has never played a journalist before: It fits him like a lightly rumpled old suit.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtogimn00743h6b5xtmwfeg@published>6. <a data-vars-anchor-text=Big href=#>Big</a> (1988)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck37urixx00243g67vzrq33oy@published data-word-count=132>This was the one that made everybody realize: Oh, Hanks isn’t just a comedy guy, he could maybe be the biggest movie star in the world. As the boy who gets his wish to be big, Hanks gives a glorious, hilarious, and sweet performance as a 12-year-old in a grown-up’s body. He’s limber and wild and untethered — it’s one of his best physical comedy performances — but he never lets you forget there’s a scared little kid in there. Hanks didn’t win Best Actor* for this performance, even though the movie was a huge hit, which was seen by many at the time as a sign that comedy was never going to be given a break by the Academy. Nevertheless, this performance is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtoh8wf00793h6bp1ip54pk@published>5. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Apollo 13" href=#>Apollo 13</a> (1995)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck37urixz00253g677meu4qan@published data-word-count=116>There is a chance that, if you haven’t seen this Best Picture nominee in a while, all you remember of it is Hanks’s Jim Lovell saying, “Houston, we have a problem.” Go back and watch Apollo 13 and you’ll see Hanks eschewing the flash of his then-recent Oscar-winning portrayals for a no-nonsense turn as a mission commander who is bound and determined to keep his crew (Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon) focused as they and Mission Control figure out how to get their crippled vessel home. This is a performance that’s easy to shortchange, but Hanks imbues it with endlessly stirring, stripped-down authority. He makes not losing your shit in the midst of a crisis feel heroic.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtoibbq007e3h6bnd6cg67w@published>4. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Cast Away" href=#>Cast Away</a> (2000)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck38w01lj004p3g676ie7awlp@published data-word-count=118>The closest Hanks has gotten to a Robert De Niro–like physical transformation, Cast Away found the star playing a FedEx executive who goes through a personal metamorphosis after he’s the lone survivor of a plane crash. Taking time off from shooting so that he could lose a massive amount of weight for the island sequences, Hanks exudes the sense of spiritual isolation that first maroons the character but then gives him a new reason to go on living. This might be his most intimate and elemental performance, his primary scene partner being a volleyball, and Hanks finds a raw, slightly terrifying urgency within his good-guy persona that suggests that even the best of us have a breaking point.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtoj6nt007n3h6bvi87m02x@published>3. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Forrest Gump" href=#>Forrest Gump</a> (1994)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck37uriy000273g67ytd6twrv@published data-word-count=108>This Best Picture winner’s litany of famous lines — “Run, Forrest, Run,” “Life is like a box of chocolates,” “Jenny” — risks reducing the movie to a series of quotables as simple as the man Hanks played to earn his second Oscar. But the beauty of his performance is in how it both satirizes a divisive period in American history while also underlining the sincerity and optimism that’s always been part of our national character. Sure, that’s a corny notion, but it took an actor who could transform that sentimentality into something stirring and true, and nobody on the planet was better suited for the role than Hanks.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtokp9j007s3h6bqfvo4wla@published>2. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Captain Phillips" href=#>Captain Phillips</a> (2013)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck37uriy100283g67t2znhkzv@published data-word-count=95>Hanks’s terrified, vulnerable turn as the eponymous Captain Phillips is another prime example of his ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances.* Hanks’s Phillips is a good captain but also a flawed one, and one who is constantly adjusting to events that are entirely out of his control. He does his best just to stay alive, but when the ordeal is finally over and he is able to take stock, he breaks down in the most raw, wrenching scene of Hanks’s whole career. It’s a measured, calculated performance that builds to a moment of almost overwhelming power.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtolqay007x3h6b8o2i7wv4@published>1. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Saving Private Ryan" href=#>Saving Private Ryan</a> (1998)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck38vynjk00483g67mfgys4y5@published data-word-count=199>When we first see Captain Miller, his hands are shaking as he puts his canteen to his lips before beginning the D-day assault on Normandy. He’s scared, as would anyone be in that situation. The greatness of Saving Private Ryan can be measured in many ways — the harrowing brilliance of its opening battle sequence, the stunning desaturated images of war rendered by cinematographer Janusz Kamiński — but it’s ultimately a very human story, which is why Steven Spielberg cast Hollywood’s most reliable and relatable everyman star in the role. As the film pounds along and the body count builds, we learn that Miller was the kind of American hero World War II probably produced a lot of: an ordinary guy back home who turned himself into a leader of men because the fate of the planet hung in the balance. Hanks is as stripped-down as the landscape, hoping that rescuing Ryan will be enough to get him home and forget all this terrible killing. His death in the final moments haunts you long after the film’s over, with Hanks paying tribute to a lot of good soldiers who went off to safeguard freedom and never saw America again.<strong></strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck38zp06l000r3g678ml9jygc@published data-word-count=18>Grierson & Leitch write about the movies regularly and&nbsp;<a href=#>host a podcast on film</a>.
