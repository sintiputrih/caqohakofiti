The program will follow a well-known HGTV personality and real estate agent as she undertakes the most dangerous undertaking of her career. The actress also appeared on Good Bones with her mother, where they transformed small-scale damaged properties into magnificent works of art.</p><p>The new program will focus only on Mina as she converts a century-old Victorian home into a bed and breakfast and event center. Each episode will concentrate on a different area of the home, and the program will carefully follow the process.</p><p>On her website, the celebrity characterizes herself as “driven, loyal, and unpolished.”</p><p>In addition, her bio on the Two Chicks and a Hammer website stated:</p><p>“Hi! I am the co-founder and owner of Two Chicks and a Hammer, the star of the HGTV program Good Bones, a real estate agent, and a mother. I was born and raised in the Midwest. This is why I am so committed to rebuilding Indianapolis one property at a time.”</p><h2>Mina Starsiak Hawk, who starred in The Good Bones: Risky Business, is also a writer and the mother of two children.</h2><p>Mina Starsiak Hawk is an artist that specializes in revitalizing historic structures. She believes in revitalizing existing structures while maximizing their usefulness and preserving their unique traits.

According to the book’s summary, “like houses, no two families are identical.”</p><p>The purpose of the book is to teach children about different types of families and to encourage them to accept families that differ from their own. Hawk based the book on her own experiences working with her mother and stepfamily and fostering her niece.</p><h2>Mina Starsiak discusses her pregnancy experience.</h2><p>In a 2020 interview with People Magazine, the Good Bones: Risky Business actress discussed her IVF experience. The celebrity and her husband conceived their first child, Jack, without difficulty. When they began trying for a second child, however, things were not as simple.&nbsp;She based her journey on her prior experience, and after three months of attempting it, she realized that something was amiss. Due to a low egg count, the Good Bones: Risky Business actress was forced to undergo IVF.</p><p>She commented on the necessity of treatment:</p><p>It seems as though your body is failing and letting you down.&nbsp;The couple then attempted IUI, which was successful; they referred to it as their “Hail Mary.”&nbsp;The celebrity was also candid about her postpartum struggles and how she perceived her body after having two children. She deliberated for a while and heard about it, but ultimately decided to proceed and said:</p><p>“I was extremely critical of myself for wanting to do this, as it is extremely selfish. But I’ve determined it’s all right, and I just need to keep reminding myself that.”</p><p>The actress from Good Bones: Risky Business had a “mommy makeover” that included a stomach tuck, liposuction, and breast augmentation. She went on:</p><p>“It’s like having mother’s guilt because everyone else needs care except you.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mina-Starsiak-Hawk-1.jpg alt="Mina Starsiak Hawk" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The celebrity revealed that no matter what she wore, she never felt comfortable in her physique. After undergoing these surgeries, she feels more like herself and has no regrets. The celebrity said that her fans’ responses to the announcement were “overwhelmingly supportive.”</p><h2>More on Good Bones: Risky Business</h2><p>Mina Starsiak Hawk will now appear in her HGTV solo program Good Bones: Risky Business, a spin-off of the show she co-hosts with her mother, Good Bones.</p><p>She said in an interview regarding the forthcoming show:</p><p>I’ve been remodeling houses for almost a decade, tackling some of the worst properties imaginable.</p><p>Hawk described it as an enormous risk, but he is up for the task.&nbsp;In terms of scale, finance, and restoration, the six-part series will be her most ambitious endeavor to date.
