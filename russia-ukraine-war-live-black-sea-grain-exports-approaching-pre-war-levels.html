The idea is gaining new traction lately as continued allied funding for <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Ukraine</a> becomes more uncertain and the US Congress is in a stalemate over providing more support.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>There are tradeoffs, since the weaponisation of global finance could harm the US dollar’s standing as the world’s dominant currency. And the Biden administration says Ukraine still has immediate needs for funds that must be met by other means.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>At this week’s World Economic Forum meetings in <strong>Davos</strong>, Switzerland, Ukrainian president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong> called for a “strong” decision that the frozen Russian assets “be directed towards defence against the Russian war and for reconstruction” of Ukraine.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“Putin loves money above all,” he said. “The more billions he and his oligarchs, friends and accomplices lose, the more likely he will regret starting this war.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Biden administration officials who previously dismissed the idea as legally cumbersome are showing growing openness. <strong>Penny Pritzker</strong>, the US special representative for Ukraine’s economic recovery, said at Davos that the US and its <strong>G7 allies</strong> were looking for the right legal framework.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Bipartisan legislation circulating in <strong>Washington</strong> would use assets confiscated from the Russian Central Bank and other sovereign assets for Ukraine.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Even if legislation were enacted, <strong>Nicholas Mulder</strong>, a sanctions expert at Cornell University, cautioned that seizing frozen assets could undermine longer-term funding. “If the assets are transferred, these funds too will run out sooner or later. But by that time western leaders will have ceased to make any political case for supporting Ukraine, and getting support back up will be much harder.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The World Bank’s latest damage assessment of Ukraine, released in March 2023, estimates that costs for reconstruction and recovery stand at $411bn over the next 10 years.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>There have been some efforts to seize Russian funds and those of sanctioned oligarchs. In May 2023, the justice department announced that it had transferred $5.4m seized from Russian tycoon <strong>Konstantin Malofeyev</strong> to a US state department fund for rebuilding Ukraine.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1><strong>Belgium</strong>, which holds the rotating presidency of the <strong>EU</strong>, is leading the talks on whether to seize Russia’s assets.

Now, <strong>Ruslan Nimchynskyi</strong> tells Reuters:</p><p>Cyprus’s support and contribution to increasing sanctions pressure on Russia is extremely important.</p><p>A key indicator in this matter is that Cyprus supports and implements international sanctions and restrictions against Russia imposed by the EU. It is also positive that Cyprus has never stood in the way of tougher sanctions or processing new sanctions packages.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Cyprus was once considered a primary source of foreign direct investment into Russia because of the sheer number of Russian companies based on the island. But sanctions have largely put an end to that. One of the latest firm to move out of Cyprus was the Russian banking group TCS Holding, which owns the online Russian bank Tinkoff.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Last year, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists detailed how financial enablers in Cyprus tried to shield oligarchs’ assets from impending sanctions immediately after Russia’s invasion, while a small number of Cypriots have personally been sanctioned by the US and Britain.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The Cypriot government says it has zero tolerance for sanction-busting, and is receiving technical assistance from the United States to close any potential loopholes.
