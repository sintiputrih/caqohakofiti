Her husband’s name is not known to anyone. He must have left her when her children were very small.</p><p>Londa Butler seems to be around 5 ft 6 inches tall.&nbsp;She has dark brown eyes and black-colored hair. She usually styles her hair into cornrows.</p><p>Londa Butler is a follower of Christianity. She is an American. Likewise, Londa belongs to African-American ethnic background.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_007883-f7 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_007883-f7>About Londa Butler’s son, Jimmy Butler</h2><p>NBA player Jimmy Butler truly has a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rags-to-riches story</a>. His childhood was filled with many hardships and familial struggles.&nbsp;</p><p>Jimmy never got to know his father. His father abandoned Jimmy and his mother when he was just an infant.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jimmy-Butler.jpg><p>Moreover, his family also faced many financial hardships, making it difficult for them to meet. Likewise, Jimmy’s mother, Londa, was not warm and caring.&nbsp;</p><p>When Jimmy was only 13, his mother kicked him out of their house. Recalling his mother’s harsh treatment of him, Jimmy Butler remembered his mother’s final words to him in a 2011 interview. According to Butler, his mother told him, “I don’t like the look of you. You gotta go.”&nbsp;</p><p>As a result of his mother’s maltreatment, Jimmy moved out of his family’s home in the Houston suburb of Tomball. Following this, he bounced between his friends’ homes and lived there for a few weeks, then moved into his other friend’s house.</p><p>Jimmy’s life changed forever when he met Jordan Leslie in a summer basketball league before his senior year at Tomball High School. Jordan Leslie, a freshman football and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">basketball player</a> at Tomball High School, challenged Jimmy to a three-point shooting contest.&nbsp;</p><p>Jimmy and Jordan instantly hit it off. They became close friends, and Jordan even let Jimmy stay at his house.&nbsp;</p><p>Jordan’s mother and stepfather initially were reluctant to let Jimmy stay with them because they were already struggling to raise six other children. However, after Jordan’s repeated insistence, they finally welcomed Jimmy into their household after a few months.</p><p>Jordan Leslie’s mother, Michelle Lambert, fulfilled a maternal figure that Jimmy Butler lacked in his life.</p><p>Unlike Jimmy’s biological mother, Londa Butler, who never supported Jimmy’s dreams of pursuing a basketball career, Michelle Lambert always encouraged Jimmy to follow his dreams. She adopted Jimmy, and as his mother, she always pushed Jimmy to work hard in school and try to improve his basketball skills as much as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Michelle continued being a part of Jimmy’s life after high school graduation. When he went off to play college basketball at Marquette University, Michelle provided Jimmy with the moral support he needed.&nbsp;</p><p>This was the first time that Jimmy had stayed outside of Texas. Due to this, he felt pretty homesick and decided to drop out of Marquette University to move back to Texas.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, Michelle reminded Jimmy of what an incredible once-in-a-lifetime opportunity he was leaving behind. She advised him to remain at Marquette and told him not to quit so quickly on his dreams.&nbsp;</p><p>Michelle’s advice changed Jimmy’s life forever. After that, Jimmy Butler’s collegiate basketball career was phenomenal.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED</strong>: Read the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">biography of professional sports star players here.</a></p><p>Jimmy Butler was declared for the NBA draft soon after his Junior year due to his exceptional performance. Jimmy ended up being the last pick in the first round of the 2011 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. He was the 30th overall pick by the Chicago Bulls.&nbsp;</p><p>Following this, Jimmy Butler ended up having an illustrious basketball career.&nbsp; He is a five-time NBA All-Star, a four-time All-NBA Team honoree, and a five-time NBA All-Defensive Team honoree.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h3 class="kt-adv-heading_68e74b-08 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_68e74b-08>Jimmy Butler’s Relationship with Londa Butler</h3><p>Despite having a troubled relationship with his biological parents in the past, it seems that Jimmy Butler and his parents have reconciled. However, in an interview, Butler hinted that he maintains a close relationship with his parents.&nbsp;</p><p>He said,</p><p>“I don’t hold grudges. I still talk to my family. My mom. My father. We love each other. That’s never going to change.”</p><p>Furthermore, there were reports that Jimmy’s biological mother, Londa Butler, reached out to Jimmy after signing an NBA Deal for over $30 million.</p><p>Despite his troubled childhood and strained familial relationships, Jimmy has always maintained that he dislikes dwelling on the past and hates it when people treat him like a charity case.</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_76f008-90 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_76f008-90>Jimmy Butler’s Girlfriend</h2><p>While Jimmy Butler has a lot of female fans, the handsome basketball player is a committed boyfriend to his lady love, Kaitlin Nowak.

Besides these rare occasions, Kaitlin prefers to avoid the media spotlight.&nbsp;</p><p>Before Jimmy Butler’s much-talked-about relationship with Kaitlin Nowak, the NBA player was linked to Pretty Little Liars actress Shay Mitchell. However, their relationship was short-lived, as they decided to separate in early 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, Jimmy Butler also dated Charmaine Piula in the past.&nbsp;Confirming their relationship, Jimmy frequently posed in many photos with Charmaine on his social media accounts. However, their union could not last very long, and they eventually called it quits.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from this, Jimmy Butler was also rumored to be in a relationship with pop star Miley Cyrus.&nbsp;Miley and Jimmy were dating each other back in 2013. They were even spotted together at a few events but chose to separate after some time.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="kt-adv-heading_4ead03-85 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_4ead03-85>Grandchildren of Londa Butler</h3><p>Jimmy Butler and his girlfriend, Kaitlin Nowak, welcomed their daughter Rylee Butler on October 23, 2019.

According to her Facebook account, Londa, who graduated from Lone Star College-Tomball, has also worked as a receptionist.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, she is a dietary Aide at The Broadmoor at Creekside Park</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_258fde-52 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_258fde-52>Londa Butler net worth</h2><p>Londa Butler has an estimated net worth of approximately USD 100,000 to 500,000. Her primary source of income is her job as a private sitter.</p><p>Owing to this, the Texas native leads quite a comfortable lifestyle.&nbsp;While Londa’s net worth is remarkable, her son Jimmy Butler has an even more impressive net worth.</p><h3 class="kt-adv-heading_001381-85 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_001381-85>Jimmy Butler’s Net Worth</h3><p>The&nbsp; Miami Heat player Jimmy Butler has a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">jaw-dropping net worth</a> of approximately USD 25 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite facing many financial hardships during his childhood, Jimmy Butler earned a whopping USD 140 million in NBA salary in his early NBA career. The star player signed a four-year-long contract.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, he also makes quite hefty earnings through brand deals and endorsements. As a result, Jimmy leads a royally lavish lifestyle that most can only dream of.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the five-time NBA All-Star player has also invested in various areas, including real estate. In 2017, Jimmy sold his Chicago home in the River North neighborhood for USD 4.2 million.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, Jimmy Butler bought two condos worth USD 1 million in a newly built River North complex. He later sold one of those condos for USD 1.239 million.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, the NBA player listed his Pennsylvania home for sale. The gorgeous property located in Amber was listed for USD 6.8 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Jimmy Butler’s Amber residence is 7.8 acres and features 14,000 square feet of living space and six bedrooms. The stunning mansion also features a wine cellar and a home theater.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="kt-adv-heading_f3719d-0e wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_f3719d-0e>Michael Jordan and Londa Butler</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Since no information was available regarding the whereabouts of Jimmy Butler’s father, rumors started swirling on the internet, suggesting that Michael Jordan was Jimmy Butler’s father. The rumors result from the conjectures claiming that Michael Jordan abandoned a child in 1988.&nbsp;</p><p>Jordan was allegedly married in 1988, but he separated from his wife after the birth of their child. Similarly, the rumors also say that Michael Jordan’s former wife kicked their child out of the house at 13 due to financial hardships.&nbsp;</p><p>Since these rumors align with Jimmy Butler’s tragic childhood story, people started speculating that the five-time NBA All-Star player was the long-lost son of legendary player Michael Jordan. Moreover, their uncanny resemblance also further solidified the rumors.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, Jimmy Butler is not Michael Jordan’s son. This is because Michael Jordan is said to have abandoned his child in 1988. This was a year before Jimmy Butler’s birth.</p><p>Furthermore, no solid grounds link Michael Jordan and Jimmy Butler’s biological mother, Londa Butler. Hence, despite the longstanding rumors regarding Jimmy Butler’s relation to Michael Jordan, they are not related.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_a21855-f9 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_a21855-f9>Londa Butler’s Social Media</h2><p>Londa Butler has an active presence on Facebook. The private sitter has a total of 107 friends on Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from this, Londa Butler’s Facebook profile picture features her with two other people, probably her other children.
