minutes which are known to exist depict a typical day that has been transformed into an enigma.</p><p>Wearing flip-flops, a tie-dye blouse, and shorts, she was seen strolling through the rural trails close to Pebblebrook Road.</p><p>Her abandoned possessions were a terrifying reminder of her sudden escape from that terrible route.</p><p>When the ranger from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources spotted her that day at approximately 10:30 a.m., she could scarcely have predicted the horrific events that would transpire over the next several years.</p><p>Her family filed a missing person’s complaint with the police on August 14, 2021, the day after she vanished.</p><p>The FBI and the Meriwether County Sheriff’s Office launched an intensive search.</p><p>Days became weeks, and
