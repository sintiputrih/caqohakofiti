The two phones represent his dual lifestyle as a drug dealer and a ladies' man. He has one phone for his "plug," the person he gets his drugs from, and another phone for the "load," meaning the customers he sells the drugs to. He also has one phone for the women in his life and another for the money he earns. He even mentions needing two more phones because he is so busy juggling calls.</p><br><p>The chorus is about Gates being so busy with his business that he is constantly receiving calls on both phones, but he is able to simultaneously count money and keep his trap jumping. The verse touches on the themes of jealousy and mistrust, as people are always questioning him about what he has and what he is willing to give. However, he remains unbothered and focused on his lucrative endeavors.</p><br><p>Overall, the song showcases Gates' unapologetic nature and his ability to handle multiple responsibilities with ease.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Hello?</u><br>Answering the phone call.</p><br><p><u>What the deal?</u><br>Asking what's going on.</p><br><p><u>Bet</u><br>Agreeing with something.</p><br><p><u>I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load</u><br>Having two phones to deal with drug-related business; one for the source and one for the product.</p><br><p><u>I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough</u><br>Having two phones to separate personal matters, one for the women and one for the money.</p><br><p><u>Think I need two more, line bumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'</u><br>Considering getting two more phones as the existing phones keep ringing non-stop.</p><br><p><u>Countin' money while they ring, ring, ringin'</u><br>Counting money while the phones continuously ring with business calls.</p><br><p><u>Trap jumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'</u><br>Business is booming in the drug game with non-stop phone calls.</p><br><p><u>Button start the foreign, oh my God, I'm gorgeous</u><br>Starting the expensive car remotely and feeling good about it.</p><br><p><u>I just put the key inside my pocket</u><br>Storing the car key in the pocket.</p><br><p><u>Park it, might not get to see, this a new Ferrari</u><br>Parked the expensive car but may not get to see it due to its high demand.</p><br><p><u>Man in the mirror, how you choose to bother</u><br>Questioning oneself about how much attention they should give to the problems bothering them.</p><br><p><u>Someone steady callin', I don't feel like talkin'</u><br>People keep calling but not in the mood to talk.</p><br><p><u>Everything'll get returned the way I bought it</u><br>Expecting things to turn out the way they were bought without any external interference.</p><br><p><u>Phone be interrupting me while I'm recordin'</u><br>Getting interrupted by the phone while recording a track.</p><br><p><u>Phone be making women feel they unimportant</u><br>Women feel they are not important just because the phone keeps ringing with business calls.</p><br><p><u>Call my dawg, he say it's all the way retarded</u><br>Calling a friend who says business is going very well.</p><br><p><u>Keep the oil 'cause I am not using the Foreman</u><br>Keeping the drugs because there's enough demand and not relying on labor to earn money.</p><br><p><u>Kitchen, I just finished up a new performance</u><br>Just finished cooking and packaging drugs.</p><br><p><u>Hater, wish you well</u><br>Wishing well for the people who hate but not letting them come in the way of success.</p><br><p><u>I got clientele</u><br>Having a set of clients to cater to.</p><br><p><u>I just got it off the scale</u><br>Recently sold drugs that were weighed on a scale.</p><br><p><u>There they go again, one of my lil' friends</u><br>One of the acquaintances keeps asking for money.</p><br><p><u>They don't give a damn how a nigga been</u><br>They don't care how the person is doing as long as they get money.</p><br><p><u>All they wanna know is what I got to give</u><br>They only ask for things the person has to offer them.</p><br><p><u>How much did I spend?
