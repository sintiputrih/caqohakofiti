With work in both television and movies, she's been making us laugh for nearly two decades (longer if you were lucky enough to witness her improv career). Big fans of <strong>Poehler</strong> have an intimate familiarity with her variety of characters, but even those with scant knowledge of pop culture recognize her from Saturday Night Live, Parks and Recreation, and Mean Girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which 'Parks And Rec' Star Has The Highest Net Worth Today?</a></span></p><p>Through her prolific work in comedy, <strong>Amy Poehler</strong> has amassed an estimated net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$25 million, per Celebrity Net Worth.</a> From entertaining crowds in SNL sketches to starring in her own sitcom and stealing the show in movies, <strong>Poehler</strong> has earned her net worth through hard work and undeniable talent. The only question is, did she earn more of her net worth from movies or television? Let's dissect.</p><h2 id=inside-her-work-on-39-saturday-night-live-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Inside Her Work On 'Saturday Night Live'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Saturday Night Live is an institution. Some of the world's greatest performers have come from Studio 8H, and even more of them have graced the stage as hosts. Amy Poehler is one of those great performers whose career began thanks to Lorne Michaels. While she elevated every skit she was in, and was in so many memorable ones, she became well known through her work as a "Weekend Update" anchor, first <a href=#>alongside her good friends Tina Fey</a> and then with Seth Meyers.</p><p>While SNL is a great place to start a career, cast members don't make quite as much as one might expect. Per Celebrity Net Worth,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first year cast members make around $147,000 per season</a> (for reference, Poehler made more than that in one episode while starring on Parks and Recreation, but more on that later), and $315,000 per season after five years on the show. During her seven years on the sketch comedy phenomenon, Poehler probably earned close to $2 million.</p><h2 id=amy-poehler-39-s-time-on-39-parks-and-recreation-39-made-her-millions><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Amy Poehler's Time On 'Parks And Recreation' Made Her Millions</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To earn the big bucks in television, an actor needs to find a starring role, which is what Amy Poehler did when she joined the cast of hit NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation. For seven incredible seasons, Poehler starred as Leslie Knope, the eager, caring, idealistic, and sometimes overbearing bureaucrat-turned-politician trying to make a difference in her bizarre town full of equally bizarre citizens.</p><p>Poehler left her post at Saturday Night Live to star in Parks and Recreation, which was <a href=#>a great move for both her career and her net worth</a>. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Poehler earned $200,000 per episode of the show, although that likely wasn't until later in the series. Still, even if it wasn't until a few years into filming that she began making such a hefty salary, she probably took over $12 million home from her work on Parks and Recreation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Amy Poehler And Will Arnett Managed To Stay Friends After Their Divorce</a></span></p><h2 id=she-39-s-made-millions-starring-in-movies-too><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She's Made Millions Starring In Movies, Too</span></h2><p>Unless you're a member of the Friends or The Big Bang Theory casts, or your name is Ellen Pompeo (of Grey's Anatomy), television is not the most lucrative avenue in Hollywood. Usually the real money is in movies, but only if an actor bags a starring role. Although Amy Poehler has had notable roles, she hasn't had many starring roles, save Inside Out, Baby Mama, and Sisters. While she's definitely made millions for her work in cinema, her television career has been the real money maker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-does-amy-poehler-39-s-net-worth-compare-to-some-of-her-co-stars-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>How Does Amy Poehler's Net Worth Compare To Some Of Her Co-Stars'?</span></h2><p>Amy Poehler has worked with crazy talented people â€“ crazy talented and crazy rich. Some of her former co-stars are among the richest in the comedy world. Tina Fey, for instance, Poehler's partner in several legendary works of art and former "Weekend Update" co-anchor, <a href=#>is worth nearly triple at an estimated $75 million</a>. Seth Meyers, Poehler's other "Update" co-anchor, is worth an estimated $26 million, just eking out Amy herself. Her former Parks and Recreation co-star Rashida Jones ties Amy with an estimated net worth of $25 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between John Stamos And Amy Poehler?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inside-her-other-money-making-opportunities><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Inside Her Other Money-Making Opportunities</span></h2><p>Amy Poehler's money-making opportunities don't end with her work in film and television. Poehler is also an author who released a memoir called Yes Please in 2015. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Poehler earned seven figures for the book deal</a>, and she could have earned more from sales. Poehler has also taken her comedic stylings to the stages of awards shows, acting as host alongside Tina Fey. The two have hosted multiple Golden Globes ceremonies, and were paid $2-5 million each per show. Not bad for one night of work.</p><p>Amy Poehler has also produced, written, and directed in Hollywood, using her talents on shows like Broad City and Russian Doll.</p><h2 id=what-39-s-next-for-amy-poehler><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What's Next For Amy Poehler?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amy Poehler has had a storied and profitable career, but she's not done working yet. Per her IMDb page, she's been lending her voice to Duncanville, and will be using it again in the project Nicktoons.
