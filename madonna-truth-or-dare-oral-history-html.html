Try as they might, <a href=#>Beyoncé</a>, <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, <a href=#>Billie Eilish</a>, <a href=#>Lady Gaga</a>, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, the Jonas Brothers, Ed Sheeran, <a href=#>Demi Lovato</a>, Ariana Grande, <a href=#>Shawn Mendes</a>, and <a href=#>Coldplay</a> can’t quite replicate the novelty of early-’90s Madonna. (Time will tell whether <a href=#>Pink</a>, <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a>, <a href=#>Rihanna</a>, or <a href=#>Alicia Keys</a> can do any better.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrjlo00133e6gze4t5ly2@published data-word-count=88>Maybe that’s because Truth or Dare wasn’t initially designed to be so personal. What began as a traditional concert film ripened when director Alek Keshishian observed the seven dancers, two backup singers, and dozens of attendants in Madonna’s retinue. What came next was less a celebrity-branding ploy than an organic peek behind the Blond Ambition Tour’s curtain. Madonna funded the roughly $4 million project herself, according to producers Tim Clawson and Jay Roewe, but she and Keshishian created a new approach to storytelling, unburdened by any rule book.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrk0l00143e6gjwc1t584@published data-word-count=19>“The movie isn’t pure cinema vérité,” explains Keshishian, who scripted Madonna’s pensive narration. “It’s kind of this odd hybrid.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrk5k00153e6g5h0borec@published data-word-count=119>What’s most striking about Truth or Dare 30 years later is that, unlike the subjects in today’s pop docs, which tend to emphasize solitude and struggle, Madonna looked like she was having a ball. In the vein of the Old Hollywood luminaries she idolized, she adores being famous; she’s good at it — or at least she was, before <a href=#>becoming hyperdefensive</a> over the past few years. Long before social media warped celebrities’ self-perceptions, Madonna understood the mechanics of fame in a way that some of her peers did not. “Even if the camera followed me around for my entire life, how can you ever really completely know me?” <a href=#>she told MTV’s Kurt Loder when asked about the film’s limitations</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrkdl00163e6gt4fqm4na@published data-word-count=111>At the time, mystique was thought to be fame’s ultimate fertilizer, and Madonna’s then-boyfriend Warren Beatty<strong> </strong>scoffed that<strong> </strong>she “doesn’t want to live off camera.”<strong> </strong>Beatty wasn’t wrong, though: Madonna was an exhibitionist before everyone became exhibitionists. She came across as a freewheeling den mother and a haughty taskmaster rolled into one charismatic package, reflecting an age when celebrities weren’t yet required to seem “<a href=#>just like us</a>.” As a result, people didn’t know what to do with Truth or Dare other than gawk — and boy did they. Arriving during Madonna’s imperial phase, the movie further heightened her notoriety. Until Fahrenheit 9/11 in 2004, it was the highest-grossing documentary in history.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrkgi00183e6g5qz13e27@published data-word-count=88>Nowadays, pop docs are often produced in conjunction with an artist’s record label or management team — a glorified PR exercise designed around a curated thesis. (Taylor Swift cares about politics after all! The Jonas Brothers aren’t just Disney Channel twerps!) But Truth or Dare had less to prove. There wasn’t a huge precedent for the level of access that Madonna granted, which makes it both quaint and revolutionary. This is the story of the film’s alchemy, as told by Keshishian and several others who made it happen.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckobn2c5v000x3e6gu3ff2zsi@published>The Tour That Caused a Commotion</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/543/de8/4713c6cefe3f0ccf4a036362729024ffd3-madonna-truth-or-dare-tour-commotion.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrkr8001a3e6gzlx8o990@published data-word-count=131>Blond Ambition was Madonna’s third tour, launching in April 1990 and encompassing 57 dates across ten countries. Capitalizing on the success of “Like a Prayer,” she wanted a controversy-stoking spectacle that redefined the scope of pop concerts. The show opened with a <a href=#>steampunk homage</a> to Fritz Lang’s Metropolis, featuring Madonna simulating masturbation on a velvet bed during “<a href=#>Like a Virgin</a>” (and almost getting arrested for it in Toronto), and ending with an Art Deco segment. Jean Paul Gaultier designed the wardrobe, including the distinguished <a href=#>cone bra</a>. Already <a href=#>outspoken</a> about gay rights, Madonna dedicated one show to her friend Keith Haring, who died of AIDS in 1990, when the disease was still highly stigmatized. In 2017, Rolling Stone called Blond Ambition one of the <a href=#>50 best tours</a> of the last 50 years.&nbsp;</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrks9001b3e6gitjjn1d3@published data-word-count=125><strong>Vincent Paterson, Blond Ambition co-director and choreographer: </strong>One thing Madonna and I talked about that was very important to us was that we change the face of pop concerts. I had directed Michael Jackson’s first tour. It was always about letting the world see him as a solo artist, so we didn’t do a lot of costume changes or big set changes. But Madonna was different. I was constantly going from one [singer] to the other, and the interesting thing was they were always asking me questions about the other one. We really wanted to create a pop tour that was highly theatrical, like nobody had ever quite seen before. Bette Midler and David Bowie dabbled in it, but not to the extent we did.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrkvk001c3e6g7c98s5he@published data-word-count=68><strong>Joanne Gair, Madonna’s makeup artist:</strong> Those <a href=#>eyelashes I made</a> for the Blond Ambition tour book, which Herb Ritts shot, with little balls on the end of them — I made that by dipping broken eye shadow on the stove in a pot with melted wax. I put it on toothpick by toothpick. I would come with ideas: “Do you like these?” And that became such an iconic look.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrkws001d3e6gjc0u4rkj@published data-word-count=105><strong>Paterson: </strong>Disney gave us a soundstage [for rehearsals] on the lot in Burbank. Madonna said, “Oh, Warren wants to come in and watch today, and I want to see what he has to say about the ‘<a href=#>Sooner or Later</a>’ section.” He was a nice guy, didn’t say too much. I had her leaning against the piano in silhouette. Afterward, he and Madonna and I met in her little trailer on the lot, and we said, “Do you have any ideas?” He said, “I love it, but what about if you put her on the piano?” We both looked at each other and said, “Sounds good.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrky1001e3e6gqlxmcraq@published data-word-count=91><strong>Liz Rosenberg, Madonna’s publicist from 1983 to 2015: </strong>There was so much controversy during the tour — the religious iconography and of course that “Like a Virgin” thing. I remember saying to myself, She’s never going to get away with this. It’s not going to work, and then continuing to defend her point of view. She did get away with it, I think, because she wasn’t afraid. We absolutely thought they were going to arrest her [in Toronto]. She had the balls to say, “I’m not changing it, I don’t care.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrkzo001f3e6gdt0dmau3@published data-word-count=80><strong>Madonna (</strong><a href=#><strong>MTV</strong></a><strong>, 1991):</strong> The idea isn’t that I have to top myself, but that I have to expand my own horizons and tackle the next issue or go further in terms of creativity and what it is I want to say and what it is I want to do. I don’t want to just keep doing the same thing and saying the same thing, and the thing is that the issues that I’m interested in life are generally controversial issues.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckobn2uf1001c3e6gsjoosehy@published>“I Hope My Nana Doesn’t See This”</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrl2c001h3e6gov0jtvgz@published data-word-count=94>Concert films, like Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones and Talking Heads’ Stop Making Sense, were standard when Truth or Dare came out. Backstage documentaries, however, weren’t. Bob Dylan’s <a href=#>Dont Look Back</a> — also captured in 16mm black-and-white — was a rare exception. Considering U2’s film Rattle and Hum saw a chilly reception in 1988, no one regarded Truth or Dare as a guaranteed home run. But its natural evolution allowed for a spontaneity that can’t be achieved through premeditation. What some of the media mistook for an elaborate calculation was partly a fluke.&nbsp;</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrl4y001i3e6gzuuqy6h2@published data-word-count=66>When the movie opened, the idea of Madonna as matriarch became its oft-repeated thesis. Madonna lost her own mom to cancer at age 5, and here she was shepherding a brood of young dancers. (“My little babies are feeling fragile,” she says at one point.) One of those dancers, token straight guy Oliver Crumes III, overcame homophobia and reconnected with his estranged father during the process.&nbsp;</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrl8s001j3e6gfbbdqne5@published data-word-count=86><strong>Alek Keshishian, Truth or Dare director: </strong>Madonna had seen my Harvard thesis, which was a pop opera of Wuthering Heights. I got a call from Madonna personally one afternoon, and five days later I was on the way to Japan [where the tour kicked off]. Originally I came on just to direct an HBO special with a little bit of backstage stuff. It was just meant to be B-roll. Everything that came after was a surprise. They had talked about <a href=#>David Fincher</a> doing the HBO show.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrl9y001k3e6getg8qiac@published data-word-count=16><strong>Gair: </strong>It wasn’t until the very last minute that we were told it would be filmed.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrlbv001l3e6g78l5f1lc@published data-word-count=96><strong>Kevin Stea, dancer: </strong>When we got to Japan, there were cameras here and there. By the time we got to Houston, they started posting things on the wall saying, “If you are entering this space, you’re allowing yourself to be filmed.” We didn’t really know that it was going to be such a grand project until we kept going and it kept getting bigger. But it was never really solid until I opened Vanity Fair and there was a blurb about the movie that said “Madonna and her gay dancers.” I thought it was about her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/761/f48/0d4dbbca1d1619beb899bb60d39b0e7ce3-madonna-truth-or-dare-nana-bed.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrlcy001m3e6gtt9kjb2g@published data-word-count=69><strong>Rosenberg: </strong>I was totally against it because I don’t think the world needs to see what goes on backstage. In some ways, the best show you’re going to see is onstage, in front of the curtain. I’m old-fashioned in feeling protective and wanting everyone to see the best of Madonna. I worried that it might not have been in her best interest to show the underbelly of the tour.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrle6001n3e6gkbh43mw0@published data-word-count=64><strong>Keshishian: </strong>In Japan, I started interviewing the dancers in bed. That was the only way I could make sure they showed up. They generally would wake up super late, go to the venue, do the show, and then they would be out all night. I was just curious about who these guys were. Who are these people who have suddenly landed in Madonna’s world?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrlfk001o3e6ghorbey6e@published data-word-count=77><strong>Donna De Lory, backup singer:</strong> It was, “You’re going to get into bed, and they’re going to light you really well and ask you personal questions.” When that was happening, I thought, They’re going to be telling our stories as well. A lot of us had similarities in our background, coming from parents who were divorced or had addiction in the family. There was a reason we all wanted to be performers and wanted to be loved.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrlia001p3e6godbpna1z@published data-word-count=41><strong>Carlton Wilborn, dancer:</strong> It was surprising how in-depth they went with some of the questions, just in regards to our personal lives. There’s so much more that we talked about and shared that didn’t actually end up in Truth or Dare.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrljl001q3e6gwptu1bmb@published data-word-count=75><strong>Jay Roewe, line producer: </strong>The cameraman, Robert Leacock, whose father is Ricky Leacock, who came out of the cinema verité movement in the ’60s [and produced Don’t Look Back], instilled in us that a true documentarian comes in the room dressed in black and you sit around for a while so that people forget you’re there, and then you turn on the camera. That was part of our religion. The cast of characters revealed themselves.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrlkt001r3e6gbn6kcvdc@published data-word-count=94><strong>Keshishian: </strong>While I was interviewing them, that’s when the cog started working in my brain. I was like, Wait a second. These are all amazing kids. They’re other. In some ways, they’re broken, they’re misfits in the world, and Madonna is playing their mother. That’s why, after Japan, I came back and was like, “Madonna, the movie isn’t what’s happening onstage. The movie is what’s happening offstage with you as the maternal figure to this group of Felliniesque characters.” So I showed her the interviews I had done, and she was fascinated by it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrlmh001s3e6g6p9fptv8@published data-word-count=61><strong>Madonna (</strong><a href=#><strong>French TV interview</strong></a><strong>, 1991)</strong>: I looked at the film of me and the dancers and my relationships with the people I worked with and said, “No, this is what interests me, more than my performance onstage.” The audience already got a chance to see my performance on the stage.

A detail like that could make more of an impression on audiences because it was so personal and specific.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrt68003k3e6g9kbw754k@published data-word-count=73><strong>Brady Corbet, writer-director of 2018’s Vox Lux, in which Natalie Portman plays a volatile pop star: </strong>Madonna is just one of countless performers that influenced my decision for the character to have adopted a starkly different cadence in the film’s second half. It gives emphasis to her transfiguration from private citizen to public icon. By the film’s second act, [Portman’s character] is no longer living for herself, so she no longer resembles “herself.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrtdl003l3e6ge9s0gtft@published data-word-count=233><strong>Keshishian: </strong>I’ve spent 30 years saying no to other music docs — a who’s who of pop stars, especially in the first ten years. I could have made a lot of money and probably had a much bigger career, but I just wasn’t interested in repeating myself. Madonna was encouraging people to express themselves, and now a lot of that messaging, while it’s good, is not revolutionary anymore. Everyone’s making their quote-unquote Truth or Dare, but none of it has that impact. By the way, she asked me to do a Truth or Dare 2 many years ago. It ended up being <a href=#>I’m Going to Tell You a Secret</a>. She’d had [her children] Lola and Rocco, and she was married to Guy Ritchie. I go, “Here’s the thing, it’s kind of a conundrum because the logical follow-up to Truth or Dare is to show you now as a real mother, and yet it’s exploitative.” She was like, “No, I don’t want to make that type of documentary anyway. I want people to see the serious work I’m doing for <a href=#>Malawi</a> and my work in Kabbalah.” I remember thinking to myself, Okay, so you want to make an apology film for Truth or Dare, to show how much more evolved and giving she is. I remember saying to her, “The problem is, that’s not a movie — that’s not drama. It’s just an essay.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/21d/da4/b432bcb37e80019e855d7a136d96761d17-madonna-truth-or-dare-nana-director.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrtjs003m3e6gcozp19gp@published data-word-count=22><strong>Rosenberg: </strong>Now, 30 years later, I’m more struck by Madonna’s courage, her desire to change the cultural thinking about religion, femininity, sex.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckobmrtl6003n3e6g6eim2j06@published data-word-count=21><strong>Madonna (</strong><a href=#><strong>Entertainment Weekly</strong></a><strong>, 2015): </strong>I’m afraid to watch it.

This is not how you create stardom.” That’s why Truth or Dare worked. No other star had done that yet. Once Truth or Dare did it, you kind of can’t do it again. It’s kind of unfair to expect other people to.</p><h3 class=title>One Great Story: A Nightly Newsletter for the Best of New York</h3>The one story you shouldn’t miss today, selected by&nbsp;New York’s editors.
