At one point in his career, Momoa stated that he had no intent on playing the superhero role and getting typecast.</p><p>“I don’t want to play a superhero. Drogo may not be Superman, but it is a phenomenal role," Mamoa explained. "I didn’t want to get typecast. Drogo is an exceptional character. Conan is iconic. Whether it does good or not, you just try to elevate it to the next level."</p><p>It appears that Momoa might have changed his mindset, though. Playing the role of Aquaman skyrocketed his net worth, and <a href=#>he’s come a very long way since his days on the TV hit</a>, Baywatch.

Much of that monetary success is a result of Momoa having a hold in the DC Extended Universe as Aquaman. A role that garnered him $7 million for 'Aquaman' but a whopping $15 million for the sequel.</p><p>In addition, Momoa has been in blockbusters like, 'Fast X', with 'Fast X: Part 2' in pre-production, making him a small fortune, not to mention it is rumored that Momoa will be starring in 'Minecraft' in the near future.</p><p>While his professional life is doing quite well, Momoa and his wife, Lisa Bonet announced that they were getting a divorce after 16 years together and five years of marriage. While there were rumors of a reconciliation, they proved to be incorrect with the two deciding to go their separate ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-momoa-39-s-security-job><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Jason Momoa's Security Job</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar46278333-1.jpg><p>It was a struggle for Momoa early on, as he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">trying to make ends meet by working a security job at a nightclub</a>. His gig to earn some extra cash entailed telling bar-goers to keep it down while in the parking lot, due to the fact that the bar was located in a residential area.</p><p>"The worst job that I had was working as security," Momoa explained. "At the time, I was living out of an Airstream, but it got really hard, and I couldn’t live in it anymore. I ended up living on my friend’s couch, putting the Airstream into storage, and borrowing money."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-momoa-39-s-appearances-on-baywatch-hawaii-and-stargate-atlantis><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Jason Momoa's Appearances on Baywatch: Hawaii and Stargate: Atlantis</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jasonmomoa.jpg><p>Let’s just say Momoa’s future in acting didn’t get off to the most promising start, as he showed up to the Baywatch audition with absolutely nothing on his resume.</p><p>“When I was in Hawaii I went to a casting call for Baywatch Hawaii – it was basically like a cattle call for 1,300 people," Momoa explained via Square Mile. "I got there, and seven hours later when I finally got to the front of the line, they said, 'Oh, you’ve got to have a resume.' I was like, 'Oh yeah, well, I don’t have one.' They were like, 'Dude, have you ever acted?' I was like 'No.'"</p><p>Ultimately, Momoa made up the fact that he had gone into modeling, just so he could have something on his resume.
