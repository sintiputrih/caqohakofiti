Customers from afar come to his shop to taste Daniele’s prized pies. But amongst them, living the dream was Jaqueline Jauregui, Daniele’s wife — who had access to the judge’s bakery creations 24/7.</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this Jaqueline Jauregui Bio to learn more about her.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Jaqueline Jauregui, Daniele Uditi Wife</b></h3><p><span>Jaqueline Jauregui first met Daniele Uditi in 2010 in California.</span></p><p><span>At the time, Daniele had just traveled to the United States to work as a consulting chef for various Italian restaurants in the Los Angeles area. But what was meant to be a six-month stint turned into a permanent move, as he fell in love with the beautiful Jaqueline.</span></p><p><span>Fast forward to 2 years of dating, the lovebirds then exchanged vows on June 12, 2012.</span></p><p><span>They were married for over a decade, at the time of writing this article.</span></p><p><span>Prior to meeting Jaqueline, Daniele honed his culinary skills under the guidance of chef Rosanna Marziale at the Michelin-starred </span><i><span>Le Colonne</span></i><span> restaurant in Caserta, Italy.</span></p><p><span>However, the </span><i><span>Best in Dough</span></i><span> judge has been involved in the pastry business ever since he was 12. Thanks to his chef mother, bread-maker aunt, and pastry chef grandfather, Daniele grew up cleaning the pizza ovens and baking loaves of bread at the family bakery before school each morning.</span></p><h3><b>How Many Kids Do Jaqueline Jauregui And Daniele Uditi Have?</b></h3><p><span>Jaqueline Jauregui and Daniele Uditi share a son named Kuno. They welcomed him in 2017, and watching him grow up has been a blessing for the pair.</span></p><p><span>According to Daniele, raising Kuno around incredible food just as he did was delightful. And the fact that Kuno had a creative eye (he once topped his homemade pizza with Cheetos), was a cherry on the top.</span></p><p><span>“Kuno loves making a mess, like me when I was a kid. Anytime I make pizza, he’s in with his hands in the sticky stuff. And he’s actually very good at stretching pizza,” the judge praised his son.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, Daniele even often featured Kuno on his TikTok videos.</span></p><p><span>Overall, Jaqueline and Daniele are proud parents. On father’s day 2020, Daniele even took it to his IG to wish himself and every father out there — a “Happy Father’s Day.”</span></p><h3><b>Jaqueline Jauregui Age</b></h3><p><span>Jaqueline Jauregui was 37 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span>She is over 4 years younger than her husband Daniele.</span></p><h3><b>Jaqueline Jauregui Job</b></h3><p><span>Jaqueline Jauregui is a payroll specialist.</span></p><p><span>As of 2022, she was working as a Sr. payroll analyst at </span><i><span>Canoo</span></i><span> for 2 years.
