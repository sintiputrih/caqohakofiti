After being abandoned by his father as a small child, Lil Wayne struggled as an adolescent. The rapper not only dropped&nbsp;out of high school, but he also dealt with some serious emotional issues. At the tender age of twelve, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he even reportedly shot himself</a> in the chest, surviving only thanks to a friend in the police force who drove him to the hospital in his cruiser. Lil Wayne’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">teenage challenges</a> did not stop there. The performer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">got his girlfriend pregnant</a> at the age of fifteen and became a father to a baby girl called Reginae Carter when he was just sixteen years old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now some fans are wondering what happened to Reginae Carter. Does she maintain a relationship with her famous father? And if so, how close are they? We have taken a dive into Lil Wayne’s personal life to dish the inside scoop on the rapper’s relationship with his firstborn child.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Want To Cancel 50 Cent After His Joke About Lil Wayne Vs. Eminem</a></span></p><h2 id=party-together-stay-together>Party Together, Stay Together?</h2><p>The short answer to the question of whether Reginae and Lil Wayne are in close contact is: yes. However, the nature of their relationship might surprise some fans. This father /daughter duo actually likes to party together. The only catch? Their active social calendar got started well before Reginae was old enough to fully partake in any of the events.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even when Reginae was just a toddler, Lil Wayne was sure to include his kiddo in some of his outings. According&nbsp;to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her Instagram page</a>, she always felt very comfortable spending time with her dad in all kinds of environments. One photo features the dynamic pair at a backyard barbecue, when Reginae was still very young. In the shot, she is smiling and jumping on her dad to give him an enormous hug. Meanwhile, Lil Wayne has bent down to greet her, all while spilling his drink in the process.</p><p>While some kids may be nervous about bothering their parents after causing a spill, Reginae seems totally secure in her dad’s arms. The now young woman expands on this sensation in the caption of her photo. “I must’ve made him spill the drank. Look how unbothered I am by it.” What an adorable and organic moment!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Evans Just Mocked Donald Trump And Lil Wayne In The Same Tweet</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=years-later-means-nights-out>Years Later Means Nights Out</h2><p>Reginae and Lil Wayne’s earliest father/daughter moments may be adorable, but they- thankfully don’t even approach the good time shared by the pair now that Reginae is an adult. The reason for this change? The proud papa can actually count on his daughter to participate in the events at his side. From what we can garner from Reginae’s social media,&nbsp;her dad actually enjoys bringing his kiddo along for a night on the town.</p><p>The best example of this dynamic is a recent video from Lil Wayne’s birthday party, which shows the rapper celebrating at his daughter’s side. The two appear to be in good spirits as they spend the night jamming out and rapping together. They even bust out some dance moves side by side in an adorable moment of synchrony.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans must only read the video’s caption to understand that Reginae doesn’t see Lil Wayne as just a father; he is also a friend to her. “Imma forever ride for you,” Reginae wrote, “your biggest fan and that’s on gang.” In addition to those words of support, she showed the world that she’s not afraid to tease her dad a bit about his youthful, partying ways. “Geesh what’s the age now? Like 25,” she asked.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drake Writes An Emotional Birthday Post For Lil Wayne, The Man Who Gave Him A Career</a></span></p><h2 id=his-daughter-s-hero>His Daughter’s Hero</h2><p>Just because Lil Wayne and Reginae like to have a good time, though, doesn’t mean that the rapper is not still an inspiring father figure to his firstborn child. Reginae was not afraid to make this clear to her Instagram followers on Father’s Day, when she wrote a moving tribute to Lil Wayne.&nbsp;“I love you so much dad,” she wrote, “thanks for being my personal hero.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reginae went on to defend her father against his controversial portrayal in the media: “Most don’t know all of your powers and how strong they really are... the most powerful one is being my father.” Aww, how sweet!</p><p>The message is accompanied by two photos of the pair, which reveal how their relationship has grown over the years. The first shot features Reginae as an awkward adolescent as she plants a cheek on her father’s cheek. The second photo shows Lil Wayne holding his baby daughter inside an apartment many years ago.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Facts About Eminem & Lil Wayne’s Friendship</a>&nbsp;</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipnp%2BZo66mecKaqa2domK2qHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlksKGknXqnrdOhnKtlnJ65bsPAsqWeZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sophie-tea-painting-nudes-relationship-with-body.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How painting nudes repaired my relationship with my body">&larr;
