He might be the most desirable man in the showbiz. But if you look closely at his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">beautiful smile</a>, you will notice that odd tooth in the middle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mission Impossible</a> star has a contagious smile, but one of his teeth is a little out of place. His teeth are not symmetrical with the middle of his face. Many of his fans have noticed his front tooth, which is popularly known as the "middle tooth."</p><h2 id=tom-cruise-dealing-with-the-middle-tooth>Tom Cruise Dealing With The Middle Tooth</h2><p>After his separation from The Paperboy actress, Nicole Kidman, Tom Cruise got braces to deal with the problem of misalignment. But he was never shy of flaunting them. He was seen exhibiting them at the red carpet of the premiere of his 2002 release, Minority Report.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Cruise To Reach New Heights In A Space Project With Elon Musk's SpaceX</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 57-year-old actor is always parading his not so perfect smile. In the movie The Outsiders, the then 21 years old Tom Cruise removed a cap from the front tooth, which was chipped because of a flying puck. He never refrains from giving his 100% to his job. He never hesitates from doing what's best for his role, even if it brings out his flaws to the public eye.</p><h2 id=tom-cruise-39-s-imperfect-smile-did-not-obstruct-his-confidence>Tom Cruise's Imperfect Smile Did Not Obstruct His Confidence</h2><p>Even with a significant dental flaw, he never lacks confidence. In 1985, just a few years after he started his career, he stated why he was happy to embrace the newfound status of being a s*x symbol. It did not bother him; he mentioned to Entertainment Tonight then. He neither liked it nor resented it. It did not torture him at night.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the Jerry Maguire actor, if people feel that way about him, it means that they are happy with his work, and they remember him for that. His success is because of his ability to embrace people's perceptions about his looks and appearance.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forgotten Facts About Tom Cruise's Past</a></span></p><p>Very few people know, but the heartthrob began his career in 1982 with unaligned and discolored teeth. He used to fix them with different procedures like alignment and whitening. Since he owns one of the best smiles, he didn't wish to draw people's attention towards his face while making an effort to enhance the appearance of his teeth. Fortunately enough, he was able to get invisible braces that had ceramic brackets. It made him look healthy, and no one could notice the biggest flaw in his body.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-cruise-39-s-teeth-transformation>Tom Cruise's Teeth Transformation</h2><p>In 2010, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cruise went for a complete transformation </a>of his teeth.
