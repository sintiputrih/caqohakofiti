Heidi has been married four times and has four children. Leni is her only child with Seal, whom she was married to from 2005-2014. Leni was born in 2004, just a year before her parents got married. Unfortunately, their marriage didn’t last and they divorced in 2014. However, Leni remains close to both of her parents and often spends time with them both. She also has three half-siblings: Johan, Henry, and Lou. She’s also hosted and judged Germany’s Next Top Model, as well as Project Runway, both of which she received an Emmy nomination for in 2008. <strong>Who Is Leni Olumi Klum’s Biological Dad?</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=leni-olumi-klum-father-seals-daughter></span>Leni Olumi Klum Father: Seal’s Daughter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The biological father of Leni Olumi Klum, according to her mother, is not Seal but Flavio Briatore, an Italian businessman. Flavio began his professional career as a restaurant manager and insurance salesman in Italy. He began dating Heidi Klum in March 2003, and their pregnancy was announced in December. They divorced shortly thereafter, and Heidi started seeing musician Seal.</p><p>Heidi gave birth to her daughter, Leni Klum, in New York City. According to Heidi, Flavio is not involved in Leni’s life, who has stated unequivocally that “Seal is Leni’s father.” Seal agreed to let Flavio adopt his daughter and change her name. In December 2009, Seal formally adopted Leni and altered her last name to Samuel. Seal is a British singer-songwriter who has sold more than 20 million records worldwide.</p><p>In his professional life, he has won a number of accolades, including three Brit Awards, including the title of Best British Male in 1992. He has been nominated for four Grammy awards and an MTV Video Music Award.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=leni-olumi-klum-age></span>Leni Olumi Klum Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Leni Olumi Klum was born on May 4, 2004, and is now 18 years old. She was conceived under the sign of Taurus in astrology. Following in her mother’s footsteps, she entered the world of modeling. Klum has been captured on film for Hunger and Rollacoaster, among other films.</p><p>When she made her debut in Vogue Germany, she said it was “only a matter of time” before he began to follow in his mother’s footsteps. Heidi gave her the go-ahead to begin working in the business at the age of 16. In August, Leni walked the runway for Berlin Fashion Week and Dolce & Gabbana’s Alta Moda show in Venice while her mom sat front row.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=leni-olumi-klums-boyfriend></span>Leni Olumi Klum’s Boyfriend<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Aris Rachevsky is Leni Olumi Klum’s boyfriend. Aris, her 19-year-old boyfriend, is a junior professional ice hockey player for the Los Angeles Jr. Kings team. When her partner Aris Rachevsky showed up at the Special Screening of Netflix’s “The Harder They Fall” on October 13, 2021, their followers were surprised.</p><p>Her ex-boyfriend had revealed the date they began dating each other, but they had not stated when they started seeing each other; nevertheless, on her Instagram feed, she mentioned that this year’s Valentine’s Day was their third. Aris and Leni appear to be happy with one another, and both are dedicated to the relationship. The pair frequently posts photographs of them together on social media, and their fans adore them as a couple.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ylnKehXaS5trnIZqKlrZ2oeqO1zqWmoKGTlrlusMCdZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./corey-scherer-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Corey Scherer Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography">&larr;
