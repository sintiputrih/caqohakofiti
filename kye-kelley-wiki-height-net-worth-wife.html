He is a native of Magnolia, Mississippi in the USA. He completed high school there in his hometown. While still a student, he began earning money for his family. Since his father didn’t care about him or his mother, he began taking odd jobs.</p><p>He took his first sporadic job milking cows in Progress, Mississippi. He also bagged the groceries. However, Kyes’ desire to become a race car driver was unaffected by the responsibility of supporting the family. He worked odd jobs to earn money for his career in motor racing.</p><p>When Kye was 15 years old, he purchased his first car and started racing without a license. At South Pike High School in Magnolia, Mississippi, he completed his high school education.</p><p>He earned an honors diploma from high school, which qualified him for a junior college partial scholarship. Even with a partial scholarship, he was unable to cover his college costs and decided to stop studying in favor of working. After that, he began working at the oil refinery.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>As a young child, Kye began street racing. Before switching to street racing, he dabbled in dirt bike competition. When he got home from his job as a Superintendent at an oil refinery, he used to participate in street racing with neighborhood kids. He triumphed in numerous street car racing contests against local competitors.</p><p>The street racing team eventually decided to divide their prize money among themselves after he joined them. He has won a minor championship in street racing as well as the distinction of being the fastest competitor. According to his IMDb, he has appeared in the TV shows Street Outlaws, Street Outlaws: America’s List, and Street Outlaws: End Game.</p><h2><span id=Who_is_the_wife_of_Kye_Kelley>Who is the wife of Kye Kelley?</span></h2><p>According to reports, Kye Kelley was previously married to Alisa Mote.

He fathered a daughter while he was married to Alisa.</p><p>Additionally, it is said that Kye had a child from a previous relationship prior to marrying Alisa. However, Alisa and Kye’s separation in 2017 changed the trajectory of his love life. Then, in 2017, Kye discovered Lizzy Musi, his true love.</p><p>Let’s not forget that Lizzy Musi competes in street car races. Her father, Mr. Pat Musi, is the proprietor of Musi Racing Engines. As of November 2022, Lizzy and Kye are still together and still love each other.
