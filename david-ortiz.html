Not to mention, Ortiz is well-known for his time with the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball.</p><p>Similarly, Ortiz played professionally from 1992 to 2016, earning close to $160 million in salary alone by the end of his career. His highest earnings were in 2015 and 2016 when he earned $16 million.</p><p>As his career progressed, Ortiz began to earn more and close to $5 million per year from endorsement deals. Throughout his career, Ortiz has appeared in advertisements for MasterCard, JetBlue, Coca-Cola, Buffalo Wild Wings, Dunkin’ Donuts, New Balance, and Marucci.</p><p>Dunkin’ Donuts, New Balance, and Kingsford Charcoal were the three major contracts he obtained before retiring from baseball. David apparently posed naked for the Kingsford Charcoal marketing campaign.</p><p>Ortiz, in addition to being endorsed, is also involved in some significant business of his own. Reebok debuted the Big Papi 10M Mid Baseball cleat in April 2007, which David wore during the 2007 MLB All-Star Game in San Francisco, California.</p><p>Following that, in October 2009, David opened the “Forty-Forty” nightclub in his Dominican Republic hometown. However, Ortiz stole the name from Jay-sports Z’s club chain in New York not long after Jay-Z and his business partner Juan Perez sued him for trademark infringement. Similarly, the lawsuit was resolved in March 2011.</p><p>Ortiz is not only good at earning money, but he also contributes some of it to a good cause. In 2007, the retired player established the David Ortiz Children’s Fund to support a variety of his favorite causes and to assist children from all over the world. David Ortiz, who has a net worth of $55 million, is unaffected by the action.</p><p>The following year, David agreed to have his image used on a charity wine label called Vintage Papi. He also joined UNICEF Kid Power in 2016 as a brand ambassador Kid Power Champion for a global mission in Burkina Faso. Not to mention, a roast of David in 2017 raised more than $335,000 for his Children’s Fund.</p><h2>David Ortiz Girlfriend, Dating</h2><p>When it comes to David and his professional life, we know he is a successful individual, but what about his personal life?</p><p><strong>According to what we know, Ortiz is married and has been with his wife, Tiffany, who is from Kaukauna, Wisconsin, a town located between Green Bay and Appleton</strong>. David became a fan of the Green Bay Packers after his marriage. Similarly, David and Tiffany met for the first time in Wisconsin during the farm league.</p><p>Nonetheless, as a result of their relationship, the two have three beautiful children: Jessica, Alexandra, and D’Angelo. It was announced somewhere in 2013 that David and his wife, Tiffany, were divorcing. However, the two later reconciled and are now living with his wife in their Miami home. At the same time, David Andres, his first son, lives with his mother, Fary Almanzar Fernandez.</p><p>Ortiz previously owned an 8,100-square-foot home in Weston, Massachusetts.
