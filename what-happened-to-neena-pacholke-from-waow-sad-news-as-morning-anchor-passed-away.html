She was based in Oklahoma City. Neena spent her youth in Tampa, Florida, despite the fact that she was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee.</p><p>In May of 2017, she graduated from the University of South Florida with a bachelor’s degree in Broadcast Journalism and a minor in Leadership Studies. She then went on to pursue other opportunities. During her time at USF, she participated as a member of the women’ ball group (2013-2016).</p><p>She worked as an anchor and journalist for Florida Focus, a news brief that was shown on the local PBS-WUSF channel, during the semester while she was in her final year of college. She was given the opportunity to work as an understudy at 95.5 WPLJ in New York City during the late spring before her final year at USF.</p><p>In addition to that, she worked as a trainee for the video creation group at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa. To tell you the truth, Neena was a fan of the Green Bay Packers before she moved to the badger state. Her mother’s side of the family is originally from Wisconsin, so it was only natural for her to root for the Packers.</p><p>She loves everything about north-central Wisconsin, especially all of the cafes in the area, noisy cheddar curds, and a weekend excursion into the Northwoods to relax.</p><p>In 2019, she also adopted a cat from the Portage County Humane Society who was given the name Murphie.</p><h2><span id=Neena_Pacholke_WAOW_9_News>Neena Pacholke WAOW 9 News</span></h2><p>In May of 2017, Pacholke became a member of the News 9 team. Since February of 2019, Neena has been serving as a co-anchor on Wake Up Wisconsin, having previously worked in the media industry as a sight and sound columnist. You may listen to Neena on Wake Up Wisconsin on weekday mornings between the hours of 4:30 and 7:00! In addition to that, she is responsible for drafting and securing the 11 o’clock report.</p><h2><span id=Neena_Pacholke_Death>Neena Pacholke Death</span></h2><p>Neena Pacholke, a much-loved morning anchor here at the news station, passed away unexpectedly on Saturday. Our entire staff here at News 9 is absolutely heartbroken by the death, just as we are sure a great many other people are feeling right now.</p><p>Both the neighborhood and the individuals who lived in it held a special place in Neena’s heart. We will miss her terribly since she was a good person with a large heart and a smile that caught everyone’s attention.</p><p>During this difficult time for all of us, we ask that you remember her family in your prayers and keep them in your thoughts. Later in the week, we will have much more information regarding the life that Neena lived and the legacy that she left. Please visit our Facebook page if you would like to express your sympathies or share some of your most treasured memories. Thank you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tor5iWwW60wKmnnqaVmXq1u4ynnJ6mkWK9oq%2FHqKOknV2bv7C5jLCYqK9dqK6lec2erqxlkah6rrvRp6Cnn12Wu6S0zqtkqZmjqLKlecCwmLJn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./christopher-wool-see-stop-run-101-greenwich-interview-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christopher Wools Punk-Rock Art Show in a Fidi Tower">&larr;
