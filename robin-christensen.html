Robin’s parents are her father, Andre the Giant (Andre Rene Roussimoff), and her mother, Jean Christensen. Her father was a well-known wrestler, and her mother worked as a publicist for the sport.</p><p>Unfortunately, Robin’s mother died in 2008. Robin had previously lost her father on the night of January 27, 1993. Her father died in his sleep in a Paris hotel from congestive heart failure. On the morning of January 28, however, a chauffeur discovered him. Robin’s father had traveled to Paris to attend her grandfather’s funeral.</p><p>In addition, Robin Christensen had little contact with her father. She’d only ever seen him five times in her life. Despite occasional televised and printed news pieces criticizing Andre’s absentee fatherhood, this remained the case. While Robin did give some interviews about her father when she was younger, she is reportedly still hesitant to discuss him publicly.</p><h2>Robin Christensen Height, Weight</h2><p><strong>Robin Christensen is approximately 182 cm tall or 6 feet tall, and her body weight is approximately 96 kgs.</strong> Similarly, Robin’s chest-waist-hip measurements are 44-40-44 inches.

He was undefeated for nearly 15 years and amassed a substantial fortune throughout his career. In his will, the wrestler divided his fortune among three people. Robin’s father left two-thirds of his estate to his caretaker and wife of his Ellerbe, North Carolina ranch, and the remainder of his earnings and possessions to his only living child, Robin herself.</p><p>Furthermore, WWE pays Robin royalties because they still use Andre’s name for some events. The celebrity daughter owns the rights to the name “Andre the Giant” in any form, including video games and action figures. She was also seen promoting Brandon M. Easton’s book Andre the Giant: Closer to Heaven.</p><p>Though Robin never truly bonded or connected with her father, she later contacted some of Andre’s wrestling circle friends.

As a result, Robin’s birth was nothing short of miraculous.</p><h2>Robin Christensen’s Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Robin Christensen’s net worth Is about $10 million as of November 2023.</strong></p><h2>Social Media</h2><p>Robin Christensen uses the Instagram handle @hey Puddin 79 for her social media presence.
