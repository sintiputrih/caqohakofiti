What they won't learn from only watching the show, however, is how Survivor can affect people's lives.</p><p>For example, some Survivors have to deal with <a href=#>medical issues after being evacuated</a> while others see their <a href=#>lives take interesting turns after becoming villains</a>. Unfortunately for the former Survivor player Billy Garcia, he had to cope with being humiliated on national television and being set on fire.</p><p>This article will reveal <strong>why Billy Garcia's Survivor experience sounds like it would have been a nightmare</strong> for him. Then, the article will look at <strong>whether Garcia regrets his Survivor experience</strong> because of everything he had gone through.</p><h2 id=billy-garcia-39-s-survivor-experience-included-being-set-on-fire-and-quot-the-cruelest-harshest-edit-ever-quot>Billy Garcia's Survivor Experience Included Being Set On Fire And "The Cruelest, Harshest Edit Ever"</h2><p>Throughout Survivor history, there have been some seasons that have become very controversial. One of the most obvious examples is the show's 13th season, Survivor: Cook Islands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The reason why Survivor: Cook Islands has gone down in history as a highly controversial season is because of how the game started. When the season began, there were four tribes that were divided by ethnicity. While Survivor's producers explained they wanted the show to be more diverse, their decision to divide the tribes down ethnic lines was and continues to be controversial.</p><p>While that is the reason for the season's controversial reputation, another aspect of Survivor: Cook Islands arguably should be scandalous too. Looking back, <strong>the horrible things Billy Garcia was put through during Survivor: Cook Islands</strong> are mind-blowing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/survivor-winners-at-war-cast-photo.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Garcia didn't last long during Survivor: Cook Islands, it is an understatement to say his experience was intense. After all, <strong>the show seemed to take glee in humiliating Garcia in front of the world</strong>.</p><p>How successful was Billy Garcia during Survivor: Cook Islands?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Placement:</p></td><td><p>2nd Voted Out/Day 6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Votes Against:</p></td><td><p>4</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>During the second episode of Survivor: Cook Islands, another player, who now goes by Candice Cody after getting married, spoke to Garcia. After his tribe threw an immunity challenge so they could vote him out, Garcia told Cody he was in danger of being voted out next.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1-2024-06-17t012520-928.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Survivor's Dawn Meehan Was So Traumatized By The Show That She Had A 'Literal Breakdown' And Was Hospitalized">Survivor's Dawn Meehan Was So Traumatized By The Show That She Had A 'Literal Breakdown' And Was Hospitalized</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Survivor's Dawn Meehan was open about how suffering a "literal breakdown" and being hospitalized after playing the game the second time.</p><p>In response, Garcia told Cody he was likely to be the next player to go. Wanting to make Garcia feel better, <strong>Cody offered him some words of encouragement</strong>. Cody told Garcia "We love you." seemingly in reference to her tribe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for Garcia, <strong>he seemed to mistake Cody's comment as her professing that she was in love with him</strong>. Garcia responded by saying, "I love you." to Cody. During the rest of the episode, <strong>Garcia spoke about how he'd found love on the island</strong> before he was voted out.</p><p>In October 2020, Candice Cody spoke to Entertainment Weekly and revealed the unknown origin of her relationship with Billy Garcia. "During pregame for Cook Islands , Billy and I chatted for a moment in the pregame lockdown in one of the huts. We said we would look out for each other. That's where it all started."</p><p>Fortunately, some of Garcia's tribemates were nice to him throughout it all. One of Garcia's tribemates even seemed to be protective of him throughout everything he went through on the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/survivor-s-billy-garcia-candice-cody-and-parvati-shallow-from-the-love-scene.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, the way the episode was edited arguably <strong>made Garcia look like an utter fool for thinking Cody loved him</strong>. For example, they showed footage of Garcia's tribemates seemingly laughing at the idea of him being involved with Cody. Even <strong>Jeff Probst could be seen pretty openly laughing at Garcia</strong> during a moment the editors didn't have to show.</p><p>Years later, in September 2020, Entertainment Weekly interviewed Billy Garcia about his Survivor experience. During that interview, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Garcia spoke about how Survivor's editors made him look ridiculous</a></strong>.</p><p>"I felt I got the cruelest, harshest edit ever."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/survivor-thailand-competitor-ghandia-johnson-looked-back-on-arguably_gr-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Survivor: Thailand Competitor Ghandia Johnson Looked Back On Arguably The Show's Darkest Chapter Roughly Two Decades Later">Survivor: Thailand Competitor Ghandia Johnson Looked Back On Arguably The Show's Darkest Chapter Roughly Two Decades Later</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Survivor: Thailand's Ghandia Johnson spoke out about how the show handled one of its darkest chapters many years later.</p><p>Garcia went on to talk to EW about <strong>how difficult he felt it was to go through being portrayed the way he was</strong> on national television. As Garcia told the outlet, he believed most people couldn't go through that kind of pressure.</p><p>"You have to have very thick skin to get that edit and still show your face at Survivor events. I think most people could not have handled it the way I have. My elimination took on a life of its own."</p><p>To prove his point, Garcia spoke about how other Survivor players have complained about how the show portrayed them. "Some past players have found their harsh edits to be more than they can handle." Unfortunately, coping with his terrible edit wasn't the only crazy experience Garcia had during Survivor: Cook Islands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/survivor-cook-islands-reunion.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2014, Garcia took part in a Reddit Ask Me Anything session. During that process and his aforementioned EW interview, Garcia revealed something wild that happened during Survivor: Cook Islands. While speaking to EW, Garcia revealed that kerosene spilled on him during a challenge. While answering a Reddit user's question, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Garcia revealed the kerosens led to him being lit on fire and what happened next</a></strong>.</p><p>"At the first challenge Cristina had to retrieve a torch so we can light a cauldron at the end of the challenge. Well long story short, she lit me with that torch as we climb up to that cauldron. Probst yelled Billy's on fire. He's engulfed in flames. He was just 10 feet from me and made no move to put me out. the bastard. lol"</p><p>Considering Garcia was lit on fire and was the subject of a traumatic edit, that makes fans ask an obvious question about how the show treated its cast. <strong>Have Survivor's producers been far too reckless with the show's cast?</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-billy-garcia-regret-competing-on-survivor-cook-islands>Did Billy Garcia Regret Competing On Survivor: Cook Islands?</h2><p>During Billy Garcia's aforementioned Entertainment Weekly interview, <strong>he had a consistently positive take on his Survivor experience</strong>. Based on that fact alone, it seems very obvious that Garcia is happy that he competed on Survivor even if things didn't turn out as he hoped.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/survivor-star-jaime-huffman-romance-with-husband-erik-huffman-comes_gr-1b.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Survivor Star Jaime Huffman's Romance With Husband Erik Huffman Comes To A Crashing End With Her Damning Allegations">Survivor Star Jaime Huffman's Romance With Husband Erik Huffman Comes To A Crashing End With Her Damning Allegations</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Survivor stars Jaime Huffman and Erik Huffman fell in love on the show but their marriage fell apart amid disturbing allegations.</p><p>A perfect example of Garcia's positive outlook is how he spoke about his edit. While Garcia was very open about how demeaning his edit was, he didn't let that keep him down. Instead, Garcia spoke to EW about <strong>the pride he took in overcoming how he was portrayed</strong>.</p><p>Furthermore, Garcia expressed happiness that <strong>at least his Survivor edit made him memorable</strong>. "Now I look back and understand that it was maybe one of the most memorable edits ever."</p><p>Garcia also spoke of how other Survivors respect how he reacted to his edit. "I've shined my brightest since the edit I got aired. I've earned a lot of street cred with other Survivor players because of how I've handled it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/survivor-s-billy-garcia-smiling.jpg><p>If that wasn't enough proof that Garcia was happy he appeared on Survivor, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>EW explicitly asked him if he regretted going on the show</strong></a>. In response, Garcia expressed the exact opposite sentiment.</p><p>"I am so glad that I was on Survivor. It's a gift that keeps on giving. I've met so many wonderful people and have done so much good with the charity work. I have absolutely not regretted being on Survivor. It's been nonstop fun doing all of the podcasts, autograph sessions, viewing parties, and activities."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/04/survivor-jeff-probst.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Survivor</h5>Reality <strong>Release Date</strong> <span>May 31, 2000</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span>Jeff Probst</span> <strong>Seasons</strong> <span>46</span> <strong>Network</strong> <span>CBS</span> <strong>Streaming Service(s)</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Hulu</a> , <a data-id href=#>Netflix</a></span> <strong>Showrunner</strong> <span>Jeff Probst</span> Expand <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZoqScrnqordGcoJqrXajCs8LIr6arZZOWwLV5xLGnnqqZmruksYynoKCgpKKus7GMm5yhppRiwamxjKyanqaVqHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ernesto-zedillo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ernesto Zedillo">&larr;
