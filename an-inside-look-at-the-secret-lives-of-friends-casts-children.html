However, the lives of the children of the Friends cast members remain relatively unknown. Here is what we know about some children of the Friends cast.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends: Rachel, Monica, And Phoebe's Greatest Love Interests, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=david-schwimmer-s-daughter-cleo-is-a-non-conformist>David Schwimmer’s Daughter Cleo Is A Non-Conformist</h2><p>Extraordinarily little is known about David Schwimmer’s 9-year-old daughter, she has made very few appearances in the public eye over the years. However, a rare appearance of Cleo on Instagram sparked a lot of interest, as she showed of a shocking new look.</p><p>On June 13th Cleo’s mother, Zoe Buckman shared a picture of the 9-year-old sporting an unconventional hairstyle. The picture clearly displays Cleo’s brown hair being completely buzzed off and the result is a full buzzcut haircut.</p><p>Cleo’s mother, Zoe Buckman stated:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I see how kids today challenge norms and standards in a way that we didn’t, and that, amongst other things, gives me hope!”</p><p>Which attracted a lot of support from social media in allowing her daughter to bend social gender norms and try something still considered taboo by a lot of people. The picture also attracted a lot of support from celebrities such as Paloma Faith, who stated that Cleo “looks amazing.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lesser-Known Facts Behind The Making Of NBC's Friends</a></span></p><h2 id=lisa-kudrow-s-son-julian-doesn-t-like-friends>Lisa Kudrow’s Son Julian Doesn’t Like Friends</h2><p>Lisa Kudrow’s 22-year-old son Julian Murray Stern is reportedly not a fan of his mother’s work, most notably Friends. This may come as a shock to some, Friends is one of the most loved and well-known sitcoms of all time, so it seems surprising that Julian doesn’t enjoy it.</p><p>Lisa Kudrow’s iconic portrayal of Phoebe Buffay gained her a vast popularity and considerable fan base, although her son Julian is not a part of that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, according to Lisa Kudrow it is perfectly normal as she has never talked about her past work or roles with Julian and has never watched through Friends completely herself. Kudrow has always been adamant that she does not discuss her role as Phoebe Buffay on Friends with her son Julian.</p><p>According to Kudrow:</p><p>"We don't talk about it a lot. He's been thrilled about certain things I've done, but he's not a fan of mine and I don't want him to be.</p><p>Kudrow continued: "I want him to be my son. He should hold me accountable for parental things."</p><p>Which seems like a common response for many celebrities who like to keep their work life and private life separately.</p><p>Kudrow has also gone on the record to say that having Julian completely changed her life and changed her perspective on just about everything. She admitted: "Motherhood changed everything. I remember thinking, 'Nothing else is ever going to be as important as this. I get it. The sad thing is, a lot of things stopped being funny. There are a lot of movies and TV shows I can't watch anymore."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pair is known to have a very close bond and are a great example of how to juggle fame and parenthood at the same time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends: These Phoebe Fan Theories Make Way Too Much Sense</a></span></p><h2 id=courtney-cox-s-daughter-coco-is-a-talented-ice-skater>Courtney Cox’s Daughter Coco Is A Talented Ice Skater</h2><p>Courtney Cox’s 16-year-old daughter Coco Arquette is a keen ice-skater and has been for years, allowing her to build up some impressive skills on the ice.</p><p>To celebrate Coco’s sweet Sixteen birthday, Courtney Cox uploaded an adorable video of Coco ice-skating in a frilly pink skating dress when she was a little girl.</p><p>Courtney Cox wrote:</p><p>“Happy sweet 16th cocolo,” Cox wrote alongside the throwback video. “You’re my little quirk of the universe. I love you”</p><p>The sweet video has managed to touch a lot of people, seeing at as lovely example of motherly love. The video shows Coco dancing and showing off her dance routine, sometimes stumbling. After jokingly blocking the camera with her hand, Coco then shows off a few turns and then nearly crashes into her mum laughing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Courtney Cox shares her daughter Coco with her ex-husband David Arquette. Cox and Arquette have co-parented Coco together since their split in 2013, and Coco has always split her time evenly between her two parents.</p><p>Coco’s father David Arquette also posted a touching tribute to his daughter stating: “I’m so proud of the woman you’ve become,” Highlighting the wonderful bond they both share with their daughter Coco.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Are The Best Friends Episodes Ever Made, According To IMDB</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp2WZo8CqsMRmo6inm2KutXnToZxmq5WYv6bAjKWgr52jYrynecWroJ6mlKh6pK3Srapmm5ieuaW%2BxKdm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./snl-bowen-yang-george-santos-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bowen Yangs George Santos Invented Being Gay">&larr;
