Ashé has lived a quiet life, away from the limelight, unlike her brother. But, since acting runs in the Sabongui family, it's no surprise that she has also tried her hands as an actress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/4/16/unknown_311134124_3297404520498395_6474435835138522072_n%20(1)-1681642672575.jpg><p>Ashé has previously done a TV film called, <i>A Family Thanksgiving</i> in 2010.

Most of his fame arrived after appearing as Amon Tomaz in the DC film <i>Black Adam</i>. And he bagged this role not too long after stepping foot in such a challenging industry.</p><p>Bodhi's first work was given to him by his mother, Zagorsky. He appeared in her short film, <i>The Prince</i>. Black Adam made him famous, but he had already appeared on a DC project in the past. His first proper role was in the <i>DC's Legends of Tomorrow,</i> where he appeared in an episode.</p><p>The young actor then worked with his sister Ashé in another short film,<i> 20 Minutes to Life, </i>in 2018. This was also the year he bagged a role in <i>A Million Little Things</i>, the first role that got Bodhi noticed in the mainstream media. Between this show and<i> Black Adam,</i> he appeared in <i>The Main Event </i>and<i> The Baby-Sitters Club.</i></p><h2>Net Worth Of Bodhi Sabongui</h2><p>Bodhi Sabongui's net worth has been estimated to be under <strong>$1 Million</strong>. He makes money by acting in films and TV shows. The state of his wealth might not seem impressive to some, but Bodhi is relatively new in the industry.</p><p>Sabongui has not disclosed the salary he has received for all of the work he has done. But, the most commercially successful film he has been involved with is<i> Black Adam</i>. The film had a box office collection of <strong>$168.1 Million</strong>, as per <i>Rotten Tomatoes. </i>However, the movie was still a flop.</p><h2>Loves Football</h2><p>Bodhi Sabongui loves football, be it watching others play or playing himself.

Everyone was invested in the controversy surrounding the lead actor, <strong>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</strong>.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Johnson was directly involved in a lot of things related to the movie. He was accused of changes in the story that focused more on his character. He was also blamed for trying to take the film away from the Shazam franchise to develop his rivalry with <i>Superman</i>.</p><p>This led to a fallout between DC and Johnson and the movie sequel also being canceled. <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>CNBC</i></a> has reported that the first film didn't succeed at the box office, and it was one of the main reasons the project was canceled.</p><h2>Bodhi Sabongui Is On TikTok And Other Social Media</h2><p>Bodhi Sabongui is also a bit of a TikToker since you can find him on the popular social media platform.
