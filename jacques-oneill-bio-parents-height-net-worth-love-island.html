And by “another opportunity” they meant — to be a reality star. Yes, this athlete joined </span><i><span>Love Island</span></i><span> for its eighth installment.</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this Jacques O’Neill Bio to learn more about him.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Meet Jacques O’Neill, Gemma Owen Ex-Boyfriend On Love Island 2022</b></h3><p><span>Jacques O’Neill appeared on </span><i><span>Love Island</span></i><span> 2022 to stir the drama after the contestants were already paired up. Meaning — he wasn’t one of the early cast who stood in front of the pool and paired as the audience chose for them.</span></p><p><span>“It’s official!!! Jacques has hung his boots up for love and is entering the @loveisland villa,” his IG post dated June 11 read.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, what confirms that Jacques was bound to ruffle a few feathers in the show is his past relationship with fellow </span><i><span>Love Island</span></i><span> contestant </span><a href=#><span>Gemma Owen</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Gemma was paired with Davide Sanclimenti at the time. The two even shared a kiss! But the viewers weren’t happy with the “pair” because Davide was 8 years older than her.</span></p><p><span>The news about Jacques appearing on </span><i><span>Love Island</span></i><span> came almost simultaneous with the news about the athlete leaving </span><i><span>Castleford Tigers</span></i><span>. The super league’s club official statement read, “Castleford Tigers can confirm that the club has agreed to release Jacques O’Neill from his contract to allow him to pursue another opportunity. The Tigers have the first option to sign O’Neill back next year should he wish to return to rugby league.”</span></p><p><span>Joining Jacques in the luxury Majorcan villa for </span><i><span>Love Island</span></i><span> 2022 were his co-contestants — Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu, Paige Thorne, Afia Tonkmor, Amber Beckford, Luca Bish, Andrew La Page, Gemma Owen, Davide Sanclimenti, Tasha Ghouri, Dami Hope, Indiyah Polack, Liam Llewellyn, and Ikenna Ekwonna.</span></p><p><span>Also, Missy Keating, Kat Harrison, Brad McDermott, Sophie Draper, Jordan Spencer, and Joshua Legrove were rumored to join the show in the latter half.</span></p><h3><b>Who Is Jacques O’Neill Dating Today?</b></h3><p><span>Jacques O’Neill didn’t reveal who he is dating today (as of June 2022). Well, given that </span><i><span>Love Island</span></i><span> had just begun, Jacques must have been avoiding spoilers by keeping her love life out of the spotlight then.</span></p><p><span>Before </span><i><span>Love Island</span></i><span>, Jacques’ last known girlfriend was <a href=#>Gemma Owen</a>. the two were together for a year before they broke up in 2021. During their relationship, Jacques and Gemma attended race meetings together, and Jacques even formed a friendship with Gemma’s famous footballer dad.</span></p><p><span>On the fourth ep of </span><i><span>Love Island</span></i><span>, Gemma was even herd heard telling other islanders that her ex was entering the villa, shortly after a video clip of Jaques appeared on the screen — first hinting to the viewers Jaques was his ex.</span></p><h3><b>Jacques O’Neill Age</b></h3><p><span>Jacques O’Neill was born on May 8, 1999. That made him 23 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span>Love Island</span></i><span> in 2022.</span></p><p><span>He is 4 years older than Gemme with whom he shares a common birth month.</span></p><p><span>As per his birthday, Jacques is of the Taurus zodiac.</span></p><h3><b>Jacques O’Neill Parents</b></h3><p><span>Jacques O’Neill loves his parents and is very vocal about it. On his mother Janet Wright’s birthday (June 28, 2020), Jacques took it to his IG to share a pic alongside her captioned, “Happy birthday to the best mother out there, love ya.”</span></p><p><span>According to him, his mother raised him all by herself. She has been there for him every time he needed her in his life. “I don’t know how she’s coped with me this long if I’m honest. You’ve done everything to get me where I am today mum,” he dedicated an IG post to her.</span></p><p><span>But this doesn’t mean Jacques wasn’t cared for by his father. He was close to his dad who once even graced Jacques’s IG captioned, “Some man!”</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Jacques O’Neill Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Jacques O’Neill flaunted a net worth of under $200 thousand by 2022. And it was mostly from his time as a rugby player.</span></p><p><span>This athlete started his career playing junior rugby league for </span><i><span>Askam ARLFC</span></i><span>. He was then signed to the </span><i><span>Castleford Tigers</span></i><span> in 2019, meanwhile also playing for </span><i><span>Leigh Centurions</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Halifax</span></i><span> in the</span><i><span> Betfred Championship</span></i><span> on loan and dual registration.</span></p><p><span>In 2020, he was then given a new deal by the </span><i><span>Castleford Tigers</span></i><span> which he continued until 2022. That year, Jacques was sidelined from the </span><i><span>Castleford Tigers</span></i><span> to allow him to pursue another opportunity and also to recover from his hamstring injury.</span></p><p><span>The star previously suffered from a hamstring injury forcing him to miss the Challenge Cup Final.</span></p><h3><b>Jacques O’Neill Height</b></h3><p><span>Jacques O’Neill stands tall at a height of 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) and weighs 89 kg (196 lbs).</span></p><p><span>Mentioning his distinct features, Jacques has blue eyes, a chiseled body, and a sharp jawline.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Is Jacques O’Neill On Instagram?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Yes, find him on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>jacques9oneill_</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, here’s his Twitter @</span><a href=#><span>Jacques9oneill</span></a><span>.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Jacques O’Neill From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>This athlete hails from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Does Jacques O’Neill Have Siblings?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Yes, Jacques has a sister who’s already a mother. His niece’s name is Sophia.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmo5mTpsKmv4yopZ6hnKF6o7XOZqeaqpWjwbR5x56goKCkYrumwIywpqusmGK5sMLEZqCspJGjsXA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./steve-harris.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Steve Harris Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!">&larr;
