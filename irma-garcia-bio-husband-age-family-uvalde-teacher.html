Keep scrolling down to learn more about Irma.</p><h3><strong>Meet Irma Garcia, One Of 2 Uvalde Teachers Slained In The Shooting Rampage At The Robb Elementary School</strong></h3><p>Irma Garcia was one of the two elementary school teachers who died at the Robb Elementary School shooting. One student who survived the shooting gave an account of the gunman. He explained, “He shot the next person’s door. We have a door in the middle. He opened it. He came in and he crouched a little bit and he said, he said, ‘It’s time to die”.</p><p>The shooter reportedly barricaded himself in the classroom and opened fire on the people inside. He ended up taking the lives of Iram and her co-teacher and other 19 students.</p><h3><strong>Irma Garcia Husband</strong></h3><p>Irma Garcia was married to her husband Joe Garcia. According to their family members, they knew each other for more than 25 years and married for 24 years. They were high school sweethearts. But, not long after his wife’s cross memorial, Joe suffered a heart attack due to the immense “grief” he was experiencing and died.</p><p>Joe, who was 50 at the time of his death, had just returned to the family’s home after venturing out to leave flowers at a memorial set up for the victims outside Robb Elementary School.</p><p>He was in the kitchen and he suddenly seized and fell over no more than three minutes after sitting down on a chair with the family. One of his family members who were also at the house with the family, sprang into action, administering chest compressions until paramedics arrived to take him to the hospital. He died there on 5/26/2022.</p><p>Irma and Joe shared four kids; Cristian, 23; Jose, 19; Lyliana, 15; and Alysandra, 12.</p><p>“Their family was an all-American family,” his nephew John Martinez told Washington Post. “They’re great people. The entire family, they’re all great people. They don’t deserve this”. Joe and Irma Garcia’s love story spanned a quarter-century and included barbecues, music, picturesque rural drives, and four children.</p><p>Irma’s cousin Debra Austin said, “I truly believe Joe died of a broken heart, and losing the love of his life of more than 25 years was too much to bear”.</p><p>Joe worked at the H-E-B grocery store and was a leader at his job. He was a long father and a doting husband.</p><p>On Irma’s teacher profile, she had written, “I love to BBQ with my husband, listen to music, and take country cruises to Concan. I have my eldest Cristian son completing Marine boot camp and another son Jose attending Texas State University. <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>My eldest daughter Lyliana will be a sophomore in high school and my youngest Alysandra will be a 7th grader this year”.</span></p><h3><strong>Irma Garcia Age At The Time Of Her Death</strong></h3><p>Irma Garcia was 48 years old at the time of her death. She was born on 11 December 1973. And, she died on 24 May 2022 according to her <a href=#>obituary</a>.</p><h3><strong>Was Irma Garcia On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>No, Irma Garcia wasn’t available on Instagram or Facebook.</p><h3><strong>Irma Garcia Family</strong></h3><p>A few of Irma Garcia’s family members could be discovered on social media. Her cousin Debra Garcia Austin (<a href=#>@debra.g.austin.5</a>) has been posting pictures of Irma and her family after her death. She wrote on her Facebook, “My beautiful cousin! <span class="pq6dq46d tbxw36s4 knj5qynh kvgmc6g5 ditlmg2l oygrvhab nvdbi5me sf5mxxl7 gl3lb2sf hhz5lgdu"><img alt=❤️ width=16 height=16 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/ted/2/16/2764.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span> you will be so very missed words cannot express how much we love and miss you already. You, my love, will always be a ROCKSTAR in our lives. Rest in Peace”.</p><p>John Martinez (<a href=#>@fuhknjo</a>), Joe Garcia’s nephew is another family member who has been speaking to the media regarding the recent events as the family’s representative. He woke up with a message from his younger brother which read, “Pray for tío Joe”. (<a href=#>Alprazolam</a>) John is a 21-year-old student at Texas State University.</p><p>Less than two hours after he received the message, John received a call which to tell him that his uncle had died after being rushed to the hospital following an apparent heart attack.</p><p>On Twitter, John also shed light on his aunt and uncle’s relationship. He said, “My Tia Irma and Joe Garcia were high school sweethearts and leave behind 4 beautiful children, their ages being 23, 19, 15 and the youngest only being 13 years old, no child should have to go through this, my heart breaks for them”.</p><p>He also spoke about his aunt Irma to Washington Post and shared, “They weren’t just her students. Those were her kids, and she put her life on the line. She lost her life to protect them. That’s the type of person she was”.</p><p>Her cousin Debra started a <a href=#>GoFundMe</a> which has raised $1.82 million as of this writing.</p><h3><strong>Irma Garcia Career</strong></h3><p>Irma Garcia taught at <a href=#>Robb Elementary</a> for 23 years. She taught 4th grade and loved her students like she was their “second mother”. Irma spent her entire 23 years of teaching career at Robb Elementary. She was a co-teacher with Eva Mireles for 5 years.</p><p>One of the surviving students told, “They were nice teachers. They went in front of my classmates to help. To save them”.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Was Irma Garcia From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Irma Garcia hailed from Uvalde, Texas.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Did Irma Garcia Recieve Her Education?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>There is no information regarding Irma Garcia’s education.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmoqqdlnqordGcoJplkp68brTUrJmappRirqixjJ%2BYpqGcrnq2wsClm55lpJqupLTEq2Y%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./where-is-the-big-brother-house-located-469402-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where is the Big Brother house located?">&larr;
