Paul has become the subject of controversies throughout his career due to his erratic behavior. He has, in the past, been charged with criminal trespass and unlawful assembly.</p><p>One of the recently anticipated Jake Paul fights is his <a href=# rel>upcoming </a><a href=# rel>match </a><a href=# rel>with UFC alum Nate Diaz</a>. The bout has been officially announced and is scheduled for August 5, 2023. Tension between the two athletes has been simmering for a while now. Several reports claim that Diaz slapped a member of Paul's crew during the Paul vs. Silva fight.</p><p>Meanwhile, Paul looks to bounce back after suffering <a href=# rel>his first loss to Tommy Fury</a> via a split decision in February. On the other hand, Diaz is set for his first professional boxing match after refusing to re-sign with the UFC. Paul and Diaz will wear 10-ounce gloves in the 185-pound eight-round fight. This will be Paul’s eighth fight since he began professional boxing. Here is a rundown of Jake’s professional boxing career as we countdown the days until the highly anticipated faceoff.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-jake-paul-vs-tommy-fury-2023>8. Jake Paul Vs. Tommy Fury (2023)</h2></span><p>The Jake Paul fight against Tommy Fury was billed as “The Truth.” It took place in February 2023 in the Diriyah Arena, Diriyah, Saudi Arabia. Fury won the bout by a split decision. The fight sold 800,000 pay-per-view buys. Fury landed a higher percentage of punches, whilst Paul scored a knockdown, which stunned and staggered Fury to his knee. Two judges scored the bout 76-73 for Fury, while a third favored Paul by 75-74. Paul was initially scheduled to fight Tommy on in December 2021. However, Fury was not available for the bout due to injury concerns.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-jake-paul-vs-anderson-silva-2022>7. Jake Paul Vs. Anderson Silva (2022)</h2></span><p>A then undefeated Paul would face mixed martial artist, boxer, and former UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva. The match was slated for October 29, 2022. The Jake Paul vs. Anderson Silva fight took place at the Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale, Arizona. Paul won the fight via a unanimous decision. The bout was estimated to have sold 200,000 to 300,000 pay-per-view buys and lasted the eight designated rounds. Jake Paul’s win moved him to a record of six wins with no defeats.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-jake-paul-vs-tyron-woodley-ii-2021>6. Jake Paul Vs. Tyron Woodley II (2021)</h2></span><p><a href=# rel>Jake Paul vs. Tyron Woodley</a> II was billed as "Leave No Doubt." The fight was a rematch of the two athletes' previous fight in 2021. Paul vs. Woodley II took place on December 18, 2021, at the Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida. Two hundred thousand pay-per-views were bought during the fight. Tommy Fury pulled out of a Jake Paul fight in December 2021 due to a bacterial chest infection and a broken rib. Tyron Woodley then replaced him to face Paul in the rematch. The bout was contested over eight rounds at a limit of 192 pounds under the cruiserweight division. Paul won the rematch by knockout two minutes and twelve seconds into the sixth round.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-jake-paul-vs-tyron-woodley-2021>5. Jake Paul Vs. Tyron Woodley (2021)</h2></span><p>Jake Paul took on mixed martial artist Tyron Woodley in a professional fight on August 29, 2021. The event occurred at the Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Paul’s hometown of Cleveland, Ohio. &nbsp;The fight sold 500,000 pay-per-view buys. On May 20, 2021, it was announced that the YouTuber-turned-professional boxer signed a promotional deal with Showtime. The agreement would see his next bout aired on the network. The fight against Tyron Woodley was announced as the first to be aired on the network.</p><p>Before the bout, Paul had compiled a record 3 - 0 as a professional boxer. He was also coming off a first-round technical knockout victory against former mixed martial artist Ben Askren. Woodley was making his debut as a professional boxer against Paul. Ohio State Athletic Commission reported that Paul and Woodley earned an official purse of $2,000,000.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-jake-paul-vs-ben-askren-2021>4. Jake Paul Vs. Ben Askren (2021)</h2></span><p>Jake Paul vs. Ben Askren took place at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. Jake Paul won the fight via a technical knockout (TKO) in one minute and 59 seconds of the first round. The fight sold 500,000 pay-per-view buys. The bout was set at $49.99 and was initially thought to have sold an estimated 1.5 million pay-per-view buys.</p><p>However, professional fight executives like Dana White cast doubt on the reports. Jake Paul, in a message to <a href=# class=text-word rel="nofollow noopener">Conor McGregor</a>, later revealed that the fight actually sold 500,000 pay-per-view buys. Georgia Athletic and Entertainment Commission reported that Paul earned an official purse of $690,000 and Askren $500,000. These figures didn't include any additional bonuses or pay-per-view profits.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-jake-paul-vs-nate-robinson-2020>3. Jake Paul Vs. Nate Robinson (2020)</h2></span><p>Jake Paul proved experience matters in his return to pro boxing against former professional <a href=# rel>basketballer Nate Robinson</a>. The match went down at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, on November 28, 2022. Paul won the fight via a knockout in one minute 24 seconds of the second round out of the designated six. Although Nate held an advantage of four inches in reach, Paul's boxing training made him the better fighter. Paul had engaged in professional boxing training in the months leading up to this fight.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-paul-vs-anesongib-2020>2. Paul Vs. AnEsonGib (2020)</h2></span><p>Jake Paul knocked out AnEsonGib within the first round when he made his pro-boxing debut in 2020. The American floored his fellow YouTuber three times in the opener, causing the referee to stop the apparent mismatch. Few predicted just how one-sided the bout would turn out to be. AnEsonGib had previously won his two white-collar contests. Paul, however, easily blew him away in three minutes. The fight took place at The Meridian Island Gardens in Miami, Florida.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-jake-paul-vs-deji-olatunji-armature-fight-2018>1. Jake Paul Vs. Deji Olatunji, Armature Fight (2018)</h2></span><p>This was an armature fight between the two YouTubers on August 25, 2018, at the Manchester Arena in England. The match was both athletes’ boxing debuts. Paul took the win with a fifth-round stoppage. Jake Paul famously called out R&B superstar <a href=# class=text-word rel>Chris Brown</a> after his win. Reports were circulating that Chris and rapper <a href=# class=text-word rel>Soulja Boy</a> were considering a <a href=# rel>celebrity boxing match</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdma35xf5VmoZqjlWK9osHLZp2in5ipwA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rashmi-desai.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rashmi Desai Biography">&larr;
