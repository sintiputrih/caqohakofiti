Because guess what — people in the world around you go: “Hey, you look great! You lost weight!”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘So even the compliment about looking good is connected to weight. And that is one thing I will not let people talk about.

And this is who I am”.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On fat-shaming in the industry, she said: ‘That has changed. And it’s changed because young women now, they’re born with a voice.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘They have a voice, they’re learning how to hang on to it, they stand up for themselves.
