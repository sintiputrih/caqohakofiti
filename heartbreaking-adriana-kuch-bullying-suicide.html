She was on the floor blacked out … You guys could have prevented that."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>Other students came forward to tell their stories of being bullied at the school, including one student who even compared the environment to jail, per <a href=# aria-label="The New York Post (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Post</a>.</p><p>“I have been called multiple racist things, multiple slurs, to the point where if I hear [them], I don’t bat an eye. I’m used to it,” sophomore Roman Velez, 16, said.</p><p>Velez claimed that his requests to school officials about the alleged racist remarks were "swept under the rug."</p><p>“When people ask me what my experience at Central Regional is, it’s not, ‘I went to CR.’</p><p>"It’s ‘I survived CR,’ because coming to the school, it’s like being in a prison,” he continued.</p><p>Parents have also passionately vocalized their stance on the matter, including Rachael O'Dea, whose 14-year-old daughter endured an almost identical attack at Central Regional in January last year.</p><p>Speaking to The U.S. Sun, O'Dea <a href=#>said her daughter</a> - like Adriana - was jumped from behind by a group of girls who struck her in the head, neck, and back upwards of 30 times.</p><p>One of the attackers pinned her daughter down while a second repeatedly hit her, court documents state.</p><p>A third attacker filmed the assault and later posted the video on <a href=#>social media</a>, leading to a wave of online abuse and harassment.</p><p>O'Dea claims that the three individuals responsible for the assault on her daughter are "friends of friends" with the group who attacked Adriana.</p><p>She said there is a "problematic" circle of friends at Central Regional who have not been adequately dealt with by school officials.</p><p>In the weeks preceding the attack, O'Dea said her daughter told campus officials she was being stalked and threatened by her eventual attackers but no action was taken.</p><p>The <a href=#>school superintendent resigned</a> after criticism following Adriana's death.</p><p>Dr Triantafillos Parlapanides stepped down after concern was raised over his comments about Adriana's behavior and possible drug use.</p><p>He told <a aria-label="DailyMail.com (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DailyMail.com</a> that he had "nothing more to say" when he was asked if the comments were an attempt to avoid blame and if he thought they were insensitive.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Parlapanides also reportedly told the Daily Mail that the girl was troubled with issues at home.</p><p>Kuch's father has characterized the gruesome attack before his daughter's death as “meaningless bullying” and vowed to get justice for his daughter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdnaX95hZVpZqGdkafBo77EmqKippdirqW%2ByJqlmmWbqrCpecGuo6WxmaO0br%2FUopqinJVk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-tammy-willingham-pregnant-in-2024-who-is-tammy-willingham-698852-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Tammy Willingham Pregnant in 2024?
