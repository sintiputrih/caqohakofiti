As soon as she opened the door, she knew Aaron was “the guy.”</p><h3 class=kh><strong class=dh>Their relationship has been criticized for their 23-year age gap.</strong></h3><p class=fh>According to Sam, she knew Aaron had researched and prepared for his audition just by seeing the way he was standing and listening to a few of his words.</p><p class=fh>While the couple felt an “intense connection” from the start, they <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a33933/aaron-taylor-johnson-on-marriage-age-gap-to-sam-taylor-johnson/>kept things professional</a> while working together. Still, everybody on set knew they had something special.</p><p class=fh>In 2009, when they finished the film, Aaron told Sam he was going to marry her. It is important to point out that they had never gone on a date or even kissed at that point. Aaron Taylor-Johnson <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/a29663490/sam-aaron-taylor-johnson-interview-2019/>explained</a>:</p><p class=fh>“And a year to the minute after we met, exactly one year to the minute, I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me.”</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>THEIR 23-YEAR AGE GAP</strong></p><p class=fh>In 2013, the couple tied the knot at <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a33933/aaron-taylor-johnson-on-marriage-age-gap-to-sam-taylor-johnson/>Babington House, England</a>, making Aaron the legal stepfather of Sam’s two daughters from her first marriage. Unfortunately, their relationship has been criticized for their 23-year age gap.</p><p class=fh>Aaron once labeled the attention as “intrusive.” However, since he’s been dealing with the same problem for years, he learned to ignore people instead of surrendering to a more aggressive reaction when asked questions he doesn’t like.</p><p class=fh>Sam added she would be the <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a33933/aaron-taylor-johnson-on-marriage-age-gap-to-sam-taylor-johnson/>unhappiest person</a> if she gave “a second thought” to other people’s opinions. She said her romance with Aaron worked better than her previous marriage and has lasted longer than some of her friends’ relationships.</p><p class=fh>Due to all the scrutiny, Aaron Taylor Johnson and his wife have kept the details of their life together under wraps, but we know they share <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://nypost.com/2017/05/11/this-avengers-star-wants-to-be-a-stay-at-home-dad/>two children</a> apart from Sam’s daughters from her previous relationship.</p><p class=fh>In 2018, Aaron remarked just how much he loved his family by saying that acting was his first love and passion as a young man, but Sam and their children became their <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/aaron-taylor-johnson-interview-outlaw-king-sam-wife-children-chris-pine-a8606286.html>priority and life</a>.</p><p class=fh>He focused on being a good husband and dad so much that he even considered quitting acting and becoming a <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4296460/Aaron-Taylor-Johnson-wants-quit-acting-fatherhood.html>stay-at-home father</a>. Aaron once explained he got more fulfillment from being a parent than an actor.</p><p class=fh>Unfortunately, Aaron and Sam made headlines in April 2021 after putting their Los Angeles home for sale, making people speculate they were <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thesun.ie/tvandshowbiz/6913281/aaron-taylor-johnson-divorce-speculation-twitter/>parting ways</a>.
