Angela Deem and Michael Ilesanmi are about to end their relationship and Michael asks Angela to marry Billy. He also threatens Angela to leave because of Angela’s plan to visit Billy in Canada to help take care of Billy.</p><p>Michael thinks Angela is choosing Billy over their marriage. “You should go and marry the f—ing man,” Michael told her during the confrontation. “You want to save this man’s life? How do you have the power to save this man’s life? Do you have a kidney you want to give him? Or is your presence gonna save his life?”</p><p>“Did you really just say that bulls—?” Angela replied. “I thought you understood me when I met you. I worked in hospice. If you’re gonna leave me because I’ve got a good heart—”</p><p>To which Michael replied, “You said, even though it’s gonna cost our marriage to break up that you’re still gonna go. That means I’m nothing.” Viewers also see Michael packing his stuff and leaving. So who is the man named Billy who had parts to play in the crumbling marriage of Angela and Michael?</p><p>Find out as you scroll down.</p><h3><strong>Meet 90 Day Fiance Billy, Angela Deem Crush</strong></h3><p>90 Day Fiance‘s Angela Deem was excited to show off her friend and crush Billy on the show in midst of her tumultuous relationship with her husband Michael Ilesanmi. In the show, Angela revealed that her friend is currently residing in Canada but was in Las Vegas for a while.</p><p>Over the years, Angela has fallen in and out of love as shown on TLC’s hit show franchise since her debut in 2018. Angela appears to be moving on from her marriage with her husband Michael. “I’ve [given] nothing but loyalty to Michael for five years,” Angela opened up in the season 7 teaser. “But at this point, I got to do what I got to do for me.”</p><p>In this dynamic, it appears her crush and friend Billy have a role to play.</p><p>Furthermore, in the teaser, Angela was also seen video-chatting with Billy. “Hey, baby!” Billy greets her before showing off some of his dance moves. “What do you think about me coming to Canada?” she asks him. As reported, they haven’t met each other in real life but have been talking to each other for a while.</p><p>Now Angela is leaning on Billy amid her estrangement from Michael, whom she&nbsp;married in January 2020. “With Michael being so distant to me and making me feel like he’s using me as an opportunity to come to the U.S., I’ve had to find support in new people,” she says. “Billy makes time for me, and he listens to me.”</p><p>As Angela outlined, she intended for her duets with Billy to catch Michael’s eye on TikTok, but it didn’t work out that way. At that point, she confessed to having a “TikTok crush” on Billy. “Billy is just a crushable man. Just look at him. He’s not only good-looking. He’s charismatic, but it’s a crush,” Angela confessed about their platonic relationship.</p><p>“It’s not an affair,” Angela shared during confessional. “And this relationship would have never worked because I love my husband like you don’t just stop loving somebody.”</p><p>Besides their blossoming relationship, Angela has also addressed Billy’s health crisis. Billy was reportedly diagnosed with a kidney disease called membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in 2017. He had to undergo dialysis ever since the diagnosis because of that. Angela has used her Instagram with burgeoning followers to raise kidney disease awareness on his behalf.</p><p>And in the clip that&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé shared on Instagram, Billy tells Angela he would love to have her visit him in Canada. But she has just one concern about seeing him in person: “With all the dance moves that you have, I’m gonna run out of dollar bills,” she explains.</p><p>“Oh, you mean $20 bills,” Billy jokes.</p><h3><strong>90 Day Fiance Billy Age</strong></h3><p>90 Day Fiance Billy celebrates his birthday on 9 November. In 2022, Billy should be above 60 years old.</p><h3><strong>90 Day Fiance Billy Job</strong></h3><p>90-Day Fiance Billy wears many hats as he is a stripper and an artist and Angela introduces her as “man of many trades.” He sells paintings and proudly displays his work on his socials. Moreover, Billy’s paintings have managed to be printed on t-shirts, bracelets, and more.</p><p>In fact, Monster And Critics reported that Angela met Billy when she messaged him to do a painting she wanted to gift her husband, Michael.</p><p>As a burlesque dancer, Angela explains that “Billy is not your typical dancer.” She continues in an Instagram clip, “He used to be, in the ’80s, a male stripper. And his title was The Original Thief of Hearts. And boy, does he still have the moves and the looks.”</p><p>In November 2021, Billy appeared on an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">episode</a> of Jay’s Reel World podcast, where the host referred to him as “a high-profile performer and entertainer who found his way later into the corporate world in Toronto, Canada.” Besides that, he was also a former <a href=#>Playgirl model</a>.
