While viewers learn that he was once married, he appears to have become rather content with his single dad status and isn’t actively looking for love. That is of course before Kat spontaneously picks an audience member to tie the knot with and lands on Charlie.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>While their impromptu matrimony started out as a publicity stunt, Charlie and Kat began to develop feelings for one another throughout the course of the film and actually do make things thing official before the credits roll.</p><p>But in real life, Owen is very much like the Charlie that audiences first meet.
