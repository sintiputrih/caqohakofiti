Ortiz is a household name among real estate enthusiasts and the fans of Bravo’s reality television series Million Dollar Listing New York.</p><p>Guaynabo, Puerto Rico-born and now based in New York City, Luis in recent times was accused by his ex-girlfriend Nikita Singh of abuse, first in 2021 and then again in 2022 in an interview and Instagram Live.</p><p>Find out the rest and about Nikita in general in this ‘Nikita Singh Bio’.</p><h3><strong>Nikita Singh And Luis Ortiz’s Relationship</strong></h3><p>Nikita Singh accused former boyfriend Luis Ortiz to have financially “drained” her after&nbsp;she fled with their daughter following months of bodily and psychological abuse.</p><p>Two years after their daughter was born, Nikita had created a GoFundMe for legal fees to fight to keep her and Leela in the United Kingdom, claiming that Luis had physically and psychologically abused her.</p><p>Then, on the 20th of February 2022, she spoke in more detail about what she went through in an Instagram live and during her talk with&nbsp;Showbiz Cheat Sheet.</p><p>Now a single-mom Nikita restated her claims from 2021. She described how her life with Luis was a nightmare.</p><p>“I recall sleeping at the airport after being spit in the face. Or there were times when I would have marks on my arms and legs from being wrestled down and then told that it never happened. Or it must have been a joke, and I’m being sensitive.”</p><p>Singh stated that she was “physically abused but gaslit into believing that it wasn’t abused.”</p><p>According to People, Singh wrote in her 2021 GoFundMe description, “Out of fear I have never spoken openly about the levels of suffering I endured from Luis D Ortiz and other members of his family.”</p><p>Ortiz did not reply to Heavy’s request for comment but People reported that he denied Singh’s abuse claims in 2021.</p><h3><strong>Nikita Singh And Luis Ortiz’s Daughter</strong></h3><p>Nikita Singh and Luis Ortiz’s daughter Leela Daniel Singh was born on 8 March 2019.</p><p>The young one to Nikita is her “pot of gold”. It was, however, not known to be Luis also loved her the same way. From what Nikita says the baby daddy has not been paying child support.</p><p>Also according to Nikita, the reason she reiterated her claims against Luis is he is now trying to use his money, connections, and his powerful lawyers to “crush her”. He has made false child abduction allegations and as a result, Nikita says she and Leela may now be forced to return to the United States. “I may be at risk of losing my child… I am fearful of him and his form of abusive control over me and my daughter Leela.”</p><p>She had “managed” to distance herself from him physically by moving to the U.K.</p><p>However, the Million Dollar Listing New York fans saw some kind of story play out during Season 8. A few episodes into the series Luis had outed that he was going to be a father. He even introduced Nikita and the birth of their daughter was also aired on the show. By the end of the season, Luis had announced he was moving his new family back to Puerto Rico. Even Nikita seemed happy.</p><p>Before 2019, Nikita said her relationship with Luis was very casual. She was not looking for a long-term relationship and he too was not looking for anything serious.</p><p>The pregnancy was unanticipated and so it complicated their “uncomplicated” relationship.</p><p>When in Puerto, Nikita recalled how she hoped perhaps Luis’s family would see what was happening. But even they were no help and she was often ignored.</p><p>She said she was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused but was gaslit into believing it was not ‘abuse’.</p><h3><strong>Is Nikita Singh On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes. Nikita Singh could be found on Instagram<a href=#> @thatswhatsinghsaid</a>. On it, she entertained 7,293 followers with single parenting tips, as of 27 February 2022.</p><p>She also launched the other page ‘Life’s Leela’ on Instagram <a href=#>@lifesleela</a> (11.2K followers) aiming to help others who have gone through similar ‘abuse’ situations like hers.</p><p>Nikita also occasionally posted on her ‘Nikita Singh’ <a href=#>Facebook</a>.</p><h3><strong>Nikita Singh Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly born before 1990, Nikita Singh likely turned 31 years old in 2021.</p><h3><strong>Nikita Singh Job</strong></h3><p>Oftentimes, on social media, Nikita Singh mentioned working from home.</p><p>As a socialite, she also has launched her project called Life’s Leela&nbsp;claiming to address the abuse in South Asian Communities.</p><p>Now that her daughter is growing up, she said, Nikita will slowly begin to transition back into work mode. However, she is already beginning to feel guilty that she will get to spend a lot less time with Leela.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>What Is Nikita Singh’s Ethnicity?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Nikita Singh has South-Asian heritage.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>What Do We Know About Nikita Singh Family?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>When Nikita Singh was growing up as a child in America, her mom worked 2, sometimes 3, jobs to put food on the table.
